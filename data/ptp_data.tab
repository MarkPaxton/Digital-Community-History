This street, which has since been demolished had an interesting tier of frame-knitters windows. Stocking making or framework knitting was an industry of considerable size, in and around the Nottingham area. The main areas in the country for this industry were the three Midland county towns of Nottingham Leicester and Derby. The stocking-frame which was a hand operated machine about the size of a small loom or small upright piano was used to knit stockings or hose and other small articles of clothing like hats gloves and scarves or mufflers. Cotton, silk or wool yarn would be used. The frame work knitters worked at home, having either a frame shop or workshop in the garden or a special room often on the top floor of the house with a special extra wide window to let in the maximum light for the stockinger to work. The yarn was supplied to the stockinger by the hosier who employed him. A careful check was kept on the amount of yarn used. The amount of yarn supplied and the finished articles would be weighed and any short fall had to be accounted for. One quarter of an ounce wastage was allowed on every pound of yarn. Stocking frames were expensive. In the years 1780 to 1810 a new frame cost from &amp;pound;25 to &amp;pound;50 depending on its size and quality. A second hand frame would have cost about &amp;pound;10. Wages during this time were about l5 shillings a week and only a few pence of this could be saved. It was therefore rare for a stockinger to own his own frame. Most frames were rented from the hosier for between 9d and 2 shillings a week. The frame sometimes had to be paid even when trade was slack and there was no work for the stockinger. To find the origins of Framework Knitting, we have to go back to the late sixteenth century, when Queen Elizabeth 1 was on the throne. At that time in wool producing areas, such as the East Midlands, many people of the poorer classes supplemented their income by hand knitting socks. Men, women and children in every village and town could be seen knitting. Individuals were organised by Middlemen who worked for factors and agents. Wool was supplied, finished goods collected and payment made for the quantity and quality of goods produced. A not unfamiliar cottage industry system of production. Enter onto the scene one Rev. William Lee of Calverton, Nottinghamshire. In 1589 he is credited with inventing the first Knitting Frame - knitting produced by mechanical means. Lee having applied for Royal Patent about this date - the 400th anniversary of this important event was marked in some style by the modern Industry in 1989. His reasons for developing the Knitting Frame have entered into mythology. The Rev. Lee's girlfriend, or in some versions his wife, spent all her time knitting and had no time for him. The more philanthropic suggest that he wanted to improve the lot of the poor by speeding up the knitting process so they could earn more money! Whatever the reasons, it was a remarkable invention for 1589! The new machine produced flat plain knitting in a continuous piece some twelve inches wide. There were eight stitches to the inch and the heavy worsted would probably be between modern four-ply and double knitting wool. It was certainly as good as the heavy duty long hose that the hand knitters were producing. However Queen Elizabeth 1 and her advisers were not impressed. The Court was concerned that hand knitters would be thrown out of work and add to the growing destitution and vagrancy, which eventually led to the harsh 43rd Elizabeth, Poor Law Act in 1601. The Royal Patent was not given. Without Royal favour and approval it looked as though the venture was at an end. William Lee was made of sterner stuff and, together with his brother, packed up and went to France where they gained favour and support of the the French king. In France they continued to develop and improve the Knitting Frame. Within a decade the machine was able to knit fine garments such as silk long hose, for the Royal Court. When William died, circa 1610, his brother returned to England and set up a workshop in London, producing quality silk hose for the gentry. The industry spread in the capital and, in 1663, the Worshipful Company of Framework Knitters were granted a Royal Charter. So, how did the industry get back to the East Midlands? Certain London Knitters were unhappy at the controls imposed on them by the Guild in London. William Illiffe set up some frames in his native Hinckley in 1641. Others, taking advantage of the unrest caused by the Civil War, also moved to the East Midlands, a major wool producing centre and hand knitting area. By the time of the Restoration in 1660 knitting frames were in Leicester and many other villages, for example, Wigston in 1680. In the next 100 years, using the existing cottage industry set-up, Framework Knitting spread throughout the East Midlands. This period coincided with the Enclosure of much of the farmland and many people left agriculture to take up framework knitting. By the early 1800's, of the 45,000 Knitting Frames in the country, 90% were in the East Midlands. The making of long hose suited a family unit, the man did the the knitting, the woman did the sewing up and the children wound the hanks of wool onto cones. The Knitting Frame, incorporating a seat and foot pedals, supports the metal knitting machine. A row of fixed hooked needles hold the knitting, whilst the operator works on the new row. On 19th century machines, five or six rows of knitting with 288 stitches to the row could be achieved in one minute. Development of the the machine continued through the years, but even a machine built in the early 20th century would still have been familiar to William Lee. By the 19th century, Derbyshire was concentrating on the production of silk garments, Nottinghamshire on cotton, such as Nottingham Lace, and Leicestershire on worsted, woollen garments. As the 19th century progressed trade slumped as fashions changed, long hose was no longer needed and gentlemen went into trousers, The factory system began to replace the cottage industry and machines were developed to use first steam, then electric power. By 1811, as the frameknitters of the Midlands were being forced to rent the frames they worked on by the manufactures, hosiers, only a year later mass production was being introduced by the use of wide knitting frames. These frames made the work less labor intensive, because the stockings were made of a one cut piece of material, which was called a 'cut-up.' Consequently, stockings were cheaper to manufacture. The knitters felt that these methods of manufacturing were displacing skilled labor and that the deterioration in quality, due to the cheaper production practices, was producing the decline in the purchase of stockings. There were many manufactures who agreed with the knitters but the practice was becoming so common that the only way for them to compete was to follow their competitors lead. The manufacturers, having found profit saving methods, began to employ various methods to either lower or to defraud the knitters, weavers, and croppers of their earnings. They were able to do this because there were no laws in place to control the amount or method of payment for wages. Many manufacturers would just simply not display schedules of prices for work, this way they could pay their workers whatever they felt like paying them. In some instances workers were paid with store credit, which was only good for purchasing items at a company store. This was tough on the workers because most of the items were over priced. If a manufacture did not use either one or both of these methods to cheat their workers he would pay them in 'truck' payments. By adopting this practice they could pay the workers with goods instead of money. At that time petitions, from the cotton districts, began to pour into Parliament for relief of the unjust practices of the manufacturers. But Parliament dismissed their pleas and the workers knew that any continued political outcry would be met either with death or with banishment to one of the colonies. With such thoughts in their minds the working classes were becoming very discontent during 1811. That same year in the town of Arnold, outside Nottingham, knitters stole the jack wires out of the knitting frames during the months of February and March. The Jack wires were deposited in the churches as 'hostages' for the good behavior of their owners. But the owners did not cave into the demands of the 'hostage' takers. On March 11th a crowd of framework knitters gathered in the market place at Nottingham. The crowd was so large and volatile that town officials called in the militia to disperse them. That same day during the evening some 60 knitting frames were broken in Arnold. The frames which were broken were only those that belonged to hated manufacturers. For weeks after this knitting frames continued to be broken and the attacks became more widespread. The incidents did not cease until April by which point there were over 200 broken frames. Later that same year, in November, the disturbances began once again. On the night of November 4th six frames were destroyed in the village of Bulwell. All six machines were wide frames. A few days later a mob, led by someone calling himself 'Ned Lud', broke into the knitting shop of Edward Hollingsworth--a notorious and hated hosier--and broke several of his frames. Shortly after this attack, On the 13th of November, a great mob was formed by workers from Hucknall, Kirby, and Bulwell. Together they proceeded to destroy many of the knitting frames at Bett's Workshop. By the end of the month the attackers had become so emboldened, by their success and support, that they were even breaking machines in broad daylight. Eventually the attacks drew the attention of Parliament, which decided to send a squadron of Dragons to assist the local militias. However even the presence of the Dragons did not deter the attackers. By December 15, 1811 there was an army of some 900 cavalry and 1,000 infantry being led by General Dyott. General Dyott's army along with the local militias began to chase the Luddites, but this did not deter the Luds. By 1812 Parliament became so distressed by the situation, especially when they looked at what had been occurring in Europe since the French Revolution, that they placed Lieutenant General Thomas Maitland in charge of a force of some 35,000 men to stop the Luddite attacks. Maitland followed his directive and by the following December the revolts were stopped. Those Luddites who were caught were tried and hanged. The efforts of the Luds had little effect on the lives of the hard-pressed Frame-work knitters. In september 1819 they brought their frames into Nottingham and piled them in front of the hosiers doors, and many begged from door to door. The Royal Commission in 1845 found that three quarters of all Framework Knitters were either unemployed or seriously under-employed and dependent on Parish relief. By the First World war the handframe industry was virtually dead, though some pockets of handframe knitting survived until the Second World War and Hurts in Nottinghamshire kept a few frames working until the 1980's. We are left with little physical evidence of this once important industry. One of the best clues to the existence of Frame-work knitting is the long uninterrupted window in some garden workshop or attic roof, an over large window in a house or a window that has clearly been increased in size. All these clues point to the Frame-work knitters need for good light on the knitting area. Many such buildings have survived in the area, although a good many were demolished in post World War I and II housing improvement programmes.	11 May 1914	11_The_1910s	Nottingham City Council				Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	cobbled street women terraced houses frame knitters windows weavers smog urban posters textile industry	Buildings_and_Structures Housing Work_and_Industry Industries_and_Production

The gabled building on the left was the Town Mission Ragged School, bearing it's name on the chimney stack and it's date of construction, 1858. Used as a cash and carry warehouse at the time of the photograph. The idea of ragged schools was developed by John Pounds, a Portsmouth shoemaker. In 1818 Pounds began teaching poor children without charging fees. Thomas Guthrie helped to promote Pounds' idea of free schooling for working class children. Guthrie started a ragged school in Edinburgh and Sheriff Watson established another in Aberdeen. Lord Shaftesbury formed the Ragged School Union in 1844 and over the next eight years over 200 free schools for poor children were established in Britain. The Old Ragged School is now the new headquarters of the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust. When taken over in the late 1990s it was a derelict, listed pre-Education Act (1870) school on the 'Buildings At Risk Register' and at risk of demolition. The restoration was supported by funding from ERDF, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the landfill tax. The project incorporated recycled materials, timber from managed sources, insulation, heat recovery systems, condensing boilers and low energy light fittings. It was later awarded Nottingham City Council Lord Mayor's Award for Conservation and Nottingham Civic Society Commendation. The modern brick construction at the centre is the sauna and leisure centre part of Victoria Baths, opened in 1975 and replaced a row of lock-up shops, demolished in 1973.

NTGM000671	27698	SK5740		52.95435674	-1.153011124	Nottingham	George Street - Parliament Street	George Street looking towards Parliament Street	The ornate building was Watson Fothergill's Offices, 15-17 George Street. In 1893 Fothergill had to vacate his Clinton Street (Nottingham) offices as the railway was being extended into the heart of Nottingham and the land was needed for the approach to the new Victoria Station. He built his new offices nearby in George Street in a confident, flamboyant Gothic style. Just below the first floor windows are four terra-cotta panels showing the building of classical, medieval and Elizabethan buildings - the last one possibly depicts the construction of Wollaton Hall. The ground floor was designed to be a self-contained shop which Fothergill sub-let, providing an income to pay for his own offices on the upper two floors. Lincoln Street junction on the left. Parliament Street Methodist Church at the end of the street to the left.	1968	16_The_1960s	Roberts, George L				Yes	George L Roberts	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	street church tower lamp buttresses gable eaves board Gothic windows oriel turret sculpture shops	Buildings_and_Structures Offices Religious_Buildings Shops_Banks_and_Commercial

His passion for pedalling is such that Reg - a familiar grey-bearded and suntanned figure in Nottinghamshire villages - makes sure he's on the road every day. And now Reg, 58, usually bare-chested, and in shorts and sandals, has reached a golden milestone - 50 years in the saddle. He tell us it was exactly 50 years ago today that he began cycling. And he has not stopped! Until recently, he averaged 10,000 miles a year on his trusty machine, keeping a log of his journeys. Even now, he cycles up to 200 miles a week. He has ridden as far as Devon and South Wales, and is proud of a three and a half hour run to Skegness. But most of his trips are within Nottinghamshire, where he makes regular stops to indulge his other interest of photographing subjects of architectural or historical interest for the local studies library. Then it's back on the bike - a five-speed Falcon racing model. And it's on the bike he'll be on his golden jubilee day on Monday. Said Reg, who lives in Galena Drive, Carlton: 'Give me my bike, a bit of sunshine - and a stop-off for a lunchtime pint - and I'm a happy man.' Mr Reg Baker (who was responsible for donating many thousands of the Nottinghamshire photographs on this web site) sadly died in the 1980's.	5 June 1978	17_The_1970s	Nottingham Evening Post Group Ltd				Yes	Copyright: Nottingham Evening Post	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	cars man reg baker shorts racing racer bicycle evening post offices arcade architraves beard	People_and_Society Personalities Transport_and_Communication Bicycles

The photograph shows back-to-back housing with no internal plumbing, no through ventilation, open drains in the communal yard with a water tap at the end of the drain. The people living there would have shared toilet closets and a wash house at the end of the yard. The pile of clothes outside the whitewashed house's door are probably for 'rag picking' to supplement the inhabitants income, by sorting through old clothes, repairing and salvaging some, removing buttons and lace, before selling the remainder for rags. Also note the washing mangles, a wheelchair and iron grates of coal holes.	28 July 1919	11_The_1910s	not known				Yes	Nottingham City Council Health Department	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	slums back-to-back houses terrace drains courtyard yard women boy brick water tap poverty welfare clothes rags shutters mangle wheelchair	People_and_Society Welfare_and_Poverty Buildings_and_Structures Housing

Sneinton Market was established around 1850 and there is still a very lively traditional market held every Monday and Saturday morning, but articles for sale now tend to be new (although there is still a thriving trade in slightly worn shoes!, fruit and vegetables that are 'fully ripe', hence cheap, and 'seconds' clothing.

NTGM002167	82688	SK5740		52.95435674	-1.153011124	Nottingham	Theatre Square	Theatre Square	From Upper Parliament St, looking to the junction with South Sherwood St. Showing the Theatre Royal Centre. Over 200 years ago, the Theatre Royal was envisaged by two Nottingham lace dressers, William and John Lambert, as a 'temple of drama'...a place of 'innocent recreation and of moral and intellectual culture'. In 1865, the new Theatre Royal was completed. It took just six months to build at a cost of &amp;pound;15,000. It was the work of C.J Phipps, a 29 year old architect who went on to become one of Victorian Britain's leading theatre designers. The Classic facade and Corinthian columns still dominate Nottingham's city centre skyline. One of the most luxurious theatres of its day, the Theatre Royal provided opulent surroundings for the boom of music hall and variety, the birth of light opera, exciting new drama, touring opera and, by the twenties and thirties, the best Hollywood-style musicals and pantomimes. The Empire Theatre of Varieties opened alongside in 1898 on the site of the Theatre Royal's old dressing rooms. Backstage facilities were so closely interwoven that it was not unknown for an actor to leave his dressing room and end up on the wrong stage! By the late 1960's the Theatre Royal had become run down and had a reputation for some of the worst backstage conditions in the country. In 1969, the city council bought it and set about restoring the theatre to its former glory. In 1978 the Theatre Royal reopened, boasting elegant and airy foyers and bars, a 1,186 seat auditorium beautifully restored in Victorian style green and gilt decor and with fully comprehensive and technically upgraded backstage facilities. The Theatre Royal is now regarded as one of the best touring venues in the country, attracting major touring dramas, opera, ballet, West End musicals and, of course, an annual pantomime. The Theatre Royal's success after its renovation paved the way for the Royal Centre's second phase, the construction of a state-of-the-art Concert Hall on the site of the old Empire. The Empire had lasted 60 glorious, racy years showing risque comics, saucy ladies, mind-boggling magicians and rock 'n' roll stars, with huge billings including Charlie Chaplin and Harold Lloyd. However, it closed in 1958, and was demolished in 1969. Construction of the Royal Concert Hall began in 1980 and was completed in 1982. The air conditioned auditorium seats 2,499 and has highly complex and versatile sound and lighting system.	c 1979	17_The_1970s	Lloyd, Edgar				Yes	Edgar Lloyd	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	street theatre road junction pedestrian plant beds tree performance leisure pub columns classical	Buildings_and_Structures Entertainment_and_Sports Leisure_and_Recreation Entertainments_and_Amusements Music_and_Performances

Named after General Sir Charles James Napier. He was Commander in Chief of troops in the north of England between 1839 and 1841, which was the period of the first violent outbreak of Chartism. Napier was a down-to-earth man with a well-developed social conscience; he had little sympathy with politicians whatever their party but he did have a great deal of sympathy with the poor in the north. He wrote an account which tells of the mayor and gentry of Nottingham helping the poor, many of which were Chartists, to subvert the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act by raising a public subscription (in it he recognised the hatred of those in need of welfare relief of the 'new' system, which would force them into The Workhouse. The public subscription would give money directly to those in need.).

Watson Fothergill, whose real name was Fothergill Watson, was one of the leading local architects practising in the Nottingham area from about 1870 to 1906. During this time he designed over a hundred buildings including houses, banks, churches, shops and warehouses, many of which still survive today.

The Nottingham Brewery was situated at 52/56 Mansfield Road where York House now stands. The origins of the Brewery can be traced back to at least 1847 when James Long was listed as an East India and Pale Ale Brewer on the site. He sold the business in 1875 and after passing through several ownerships it was purchased in 1879 by Edward Wheeler Field. The brewery became a registered company in 1887 at which time it was recorded as owning many public houses of which several are still standing (including the Sir Charles Napier on South Sherwood Street and The Plough in Radford). Beneath the brewery immense sandstone cellars were used as an excellent storage location for beers as the temperature never rose above an ideal 56 degrees farenheit. In 1887, the premises were completely rebuilt to make it one of the best equipped in the country. Wm Bradford of Carlton Chambers in London designed the handsome new building in a Grecian style. Overall the site occupied 21,000 sq ft. Nottingham Brewery soon established itself as the City's main brewery, serving fine ales to local citizens from its expanding estate of public houses. It also gained world-wide acclaim for transporting its gold medal winning India Pale Ale to troops of the British Empire across the globe. The brewery continued to flourish through the first half of the twentieth century but was sadly sold to Tennant Brothers Ltd of the Exchange Brewery, Sheffield in 1944 along with 150 pubs. Bottling at the site ceased in 1948 and brewing stopped later in May 1952. On 15 June 1956 the Nottingham Brewery Company was formally wound up. Whitbread later owned the site, before it was demolished in the early 1960's and a large concrete office block (York House) was built here.

In the centre right of the picture is The Baptist Church Woodborough Road, St. Ann's, built by Watson Fothergill in 1893. At that time it was in the heart of a densely packed residential part of the city. The unusual octagonal tower, topped with a small saddle back roof and 'bed-end' finials was designed to be seen above the rows of terraced houses and shops. The church had a Sunday school with a separate entrance. Carved stones commemorate those who founded the church. The building is a lucky survivor of the wholesale demolition that accompanied the St. Ann's redevelopment scheme in the 1970s. The building is now used as a Mosque and Pakistani Community Centre.	1977	17_The_1970s	Baker, Reg				Yes	Reg Baker	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	pub inn victorian modern brick flats houses watson fothergill chapel church mosque road street tower clock	Buildings_and_Structures Hotels_Inns_and_Public_Houses Buildings_and_Structures Religious_Buildings

The Hospital consists of 13 dwellings. There are 30 out-pensioners of this charity, which was originally endowed in 1392 while Richard II was on the throne, by John de Plumptre, who was sometime Mayor of Nottingham, and who lived in an imposing house on the site now occupied by the Flying Horse Hotel, and whose gardens stretched down to St. Peter's-gate. John de Plumptre dedicated his hospital to the Blessed Virgin Mary, and decreed that it was for the sustenance of 'thirteen poor women broken down of age and depressed of poverty.' It was rebuilt in 1560, two years after Queen Elizabeth commenced her reign, by Huntingdon Plumptre, and it was enlarged in 1753. The present buildings seen today in Plumptre-square date from 1823. This illustration is from Deering's 'History of Nottingham'.	1750	08_Georgian_(1714-1837)			J Clee		Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	hospital charity dutch gable chimney tiles inscription sash windows arch door doorway	Buildings_and_Structures Hospitals_Health_and_Recuperation People_and_Society Charity

The car park on the left of the picture is on the site of Beauchamp Street. From the 1770's many co-operative enterprises were tried throughout the length and breadth of the country. Many of these early ventures failed but in 1844 a group of hand loom weavers from Rochdale found the right combination and formed the 'Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society', who are now regarded as the oldest retail co-operative in the world. News of the Rochdale example spread throughout the country and very soon many others were eager to emulate and reap the benefits from this novel method of trading. 1850 saw the formation of the Derby Co-operative Society, a group of carpenters and joiners which remained exclusive to members of that profession until 1860. It was not until they introduced open membership that the society began to grow. In the 1860's, waves of new societies sprang up helped along by the second Industrial and Provident Act of 1862 which gave the new co-operative societies the status of limited liability which helped reduce the financial risks involved when setting up a new trading society. Amongst the new societies born in the 1860's were those of Nottingham and Loughborough.

Showing Waring and Gillow's furniture Store (part of a national chain of renowned furniture manufacturers). The founding father of Waring and Gillow was Robert Gillow. Robert Gillow's fascination for carpentry began during a stint as a ship's carpenter. He travelled to the West Indies and brought back one of the first recorded shipments of mahogany into the UK. Supplies of mahogany (supplemented with copious amounts of rum) soon began to flow between Gillow and his West Indian suppliers and in return, Gillow exported some of the finest furniture ever crafted. He was later joined by this three sons and the business expanded rapidly. In addition to furniture, the Gillow's were praised in opera and fiction and they are also accorded with the invention of the billiards table. They produced a substantial amount of furniture for museums, presidents and luxury ocean liners. Queen Victoria also commissioned a number of pieces from the company. During the First World War, they fashioned Navy munitions boxes from teak and DH9 aeroplane wings and propellers. Mosquito wooded aeroplanes followed in the Second World War. Unfortunately in 1961, the firm was taken over and closed down, although Gillow's lives on today as part of Maples Stores plc. This shop seen here was formerly that of Jessop and Son Ltd (now located in the Victoria Centre). The section further down the hill with gables and oriel windows was designed by Watson Fothergill (one of his earlier designs) in 1895. Waring and Gillow's store has now gone; the Watson Fothergill section has been divided into smaller shops and the corner section of the building is a restaurant.	1985	18_The_1980s	not known				Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	shops store jessops road offices furniture windows fronts corner junction watson fothergill brick bow front gables	Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Streetscene Buildings_and_Structures Shops_Banks_and_Commercial

The Centre was to contain: high-rise flats, a multi-storey car-park, an indoor market (which transferred from the old Central Market opposite The Palais de Danse), a bus station (which had previously been site on Huntingdon Street), Jessops-John Lewis Partnership department store (which had relocated from its original King Street site), and Nottingham's flagship branch of Boots the Chemists, as well as many high street and franchise shops.

The Time Fountain is a silver-white coloured four faced clock on top of a moving sculpture. It consists of a large (copper?) flower, whose petals open on striking. It contains a variety of animals eg squirrels, peacocks and fish, playing musical instruments, that turn when the clock strikes, plus highly jewelled little flowers and floral leaf stems. Three arms are extended out, one flying fish, one squirrel and pram and a peacock rowing, as well as lots of little birds. The clock strikes every quarter hour. Rowland Emett, its creator, is quoted as saying, 'it is an aquahorological tintinnabulator.'

Showing the Victoria centre flats and shopping centre during construction. The centre and flats were built at the start of the 1970's over the cutting of the old Victoria Railway Station. All that remained of the station was the clock tower on Milton Street. The Centre was to contain: high-rise flats, a multi-storey car-park, an indoor market (which transferred from the old Central Market opposite The Palais de Danse), a bus station (which had previously been site on Huntingdon Street), Jessops-John Lewis Partnership department store (which had relocated from its original King Street site), and Nottingham's flagship branch of Boots the Chemists, as well as many high street and franchise shops. It was all enhanced by the whimsical musical clock-fountain by Roland Emett situated just inside the main entrance off Lower Parliament Street. The Centre was officially opened 16 March 1973 by Geoffrey Rippon QC MP Secretary of State for the Environment.	1980's	18_The_1980s	Lloyd, Edgar				Yes	Edgar Lloyd	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	shop trade commercial centre shopping car lamp shoppers tower block road street entrance shelter bus railings	Buildings_and_Structures Shops_Banks_and_Commercial Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Streetscene

Thomas Guthrie helped to promote Pounds' idea of free schooling for working class children. Guthrie started a ragged school in Edinburgh and Sheriff Watson established another in Aberdeen. Lord Shaftesbury formed the Ragged School Union in 1844 and over the next eight years over 200 free schools for poor children were established in Britain. The building was being used as a cash and carry warehouse at the time of the photograph. Looking from the 1st floor of Sneinton House on Brook Street. The tall building to the rear is part of Victoria Baths. The Old Ragged School is now the new headquarters of the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust. When taken over in the late 1990s it was a derelict, listed pre-Education Act (1870) school on the 'Buildings At Risk Register' and at risk of demolition. The restoration was supported by funding from ERDF, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the landfill tax. The project incorporated recycled materials, timber from managed sources, insulation, heat recovery systems, condensing boilers and low energy light fittings.

It was Nottingham's first elementary school which educated both sexes free of charge. It took its name from the blue uniforms provided for the pupils from 1725 (before this date the clothes were grey in colour). The movement to set up charity schools began in the late seventeenth century as an attempt to combat crime and un-Christian behaviour. It sought to provide schooling for the children of the poor in 'pious instruction and education in the knowledge and practice of true religion'. The school was funded by voluntary subscription. After an initial meeting on 27 February 1706 to gain subscribers to the venture, the school opened on 1 May 1707, not at the building seen here, but possibly in a house loaned for the purpose in St Mary's Gate. The Nottingham Charity School undertook to clothe and teach forty children (25 male and 15 female) aged between 7 and 14, and apprentice them when their education was completed. In selecting pupils, the Trustees gave preference to orphans and those from large families. The children of those receiving poor relief were not eligible. In 1723 the school moved to its first permanent location on High Pavement in a handsome building opposite Garners Hill. The school moved again in 1853 to a building on the west side of Mansfield Road (near the junction with Woodborough Road) seen here, which is now the International Community Centre. The School has now re-located yet again to far larger premises on Aspley Lane, which were opened in 1967.	1921	12_The_1920s	Briscoe, W A				Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	school victorian charity gables turrets clock corner road junction factory tram cables post people bellcote arched mullion windows buttressed trees education	Buildings_and_Structures Schools_Colleges_and_Universities Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Streetscene

NTGM005584	85120	SK5740		52.95435674	-1.153011124	Nottingham	Milton Street	Mechanics Institute - interior	The idea of a Mechanics Institutes first emerged in Scotland at the end of the 18th century. At the University of Glasgow, two professors, John Anderson and George Birkbeck began offering free lectures to the working people of Glasgow. When Anderson died in 1796 he left all the money he had to found Anderson's College. Birkbeck worked as professor of natural philosophy at the college but eventually moved to London where he founded the London Mechanics Institute.

These self-improving working men's adult education colleges were often funded by wealthy local industrialists.

They were places where artisans could learn, part-time, the basic principles of science, particularly mechanics, physics and chemistry.

It was lit by 5 clusters of 81 gas jets. The balcony was fitted with easy cushioned stalls, and the groud floor with chairs. See R Iliffe and W Baguley's book 'Victorian Nottingham', Vol 14 The Mechanics Institute stood at the junction of Milton Street, Burton Street and Trinity Square, opposite the old entrance to Victoria Station (now Victoria Centre). It comprised of a group of buildings; The Mechanic's Institute Large Hall, a members refreshment room, a former Baptist Chapel built in a Romanesque style which was purchased by the Mechanics in 1912 and was known as The Queens Hall. On march 26th the large hall became a cinema and was called Mechanics Pictures. (All these Victorian buildings have been demolished and replaced by Birkbeck House, a somewhat ugly 'modern' office block, which itself is again waiting for re-development. The Mechanics Institute was incorporated into this building.) The idea of a Mechanics Institutes first emerged in Scotland at the end of the 18th century.

The idea of ragged schools was developed by John Pounds, a Portsmouth shoemaker. In 1818 Pounds began teaching poor children without charging fees. Thomas Guthrie helped to promote Pounds' idea of free schooling for working class children. Guthrie started a ragged school in Edinburgh and Sheriff Watson established another in Aberdeen. Lord Shaftesbury formed the Ragged School Union in 1844 and over the next eight years over 200 free schools for poor children were established in Britain. The building was being used as a cash and carry warehouse at the time of the photograph. Looking from the 1st floor of Sneinton House on Brook Street. The tall building to the rear is part of Victoria Baths. The Old Ragged School is now the new headquarters of the Nottinghamshire Wildlife Trust. When taken over in the late 1990s it was a derelict, listed pre-Education Act (1870) school on the 'Buildings At Risk Register' and at risk of demolition. The restoration was supported by funding from ERDF, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the landfill tax. The project incorporated recycled materials, timber from managed sources, insulation, heat recovery systems, condensing boilers and low energy light fittings. It was later awarded Nottingham City Council Lord Mayor's Award for Conservation and Nottingham Civic Society Commendation.	21 October 1992	19_The_1990s	Whitworth, J D				Yes	J D Whitworth	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	school education learning stone ragged arch fanlight datestone carved inscription pavement sign boarded	Buildings_and_Structures Schools_Colleges_and_Universities Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Streetscene

NTGM005603	61982	SK5740		52.95435674	-1.153011124	Nottingham	Mansfield Road	Bluecoat School	The Bluecoat School was founded in 1706 by Timothy Fenton, rector of St Peter's Church (1705-21), and the incumbents of the two other Nottingham parishes, St Mary's and St Nicholas'. It was Nottingham's first elementary school which educated both sexes free of charge. It took its name from the blue uniforms provided for the pupils from 1725 (before this date the clothes were grey in colour). The movement to set up charity schools began in the late seventeenth century as an attempt to combat crime and un-Christian behaviour. It sought to provide schooling for the children of the poor in 'pious instruction and education in the knowledge and practice of true religion'. The school was funded by voluntary subscription. After an initial meeting on 27 February 1706 to gain subscribers to the venture, the school opened on 1 May 1707, possibly in a house loaned for the purpose in St Mary's Gate. The Nottingham Charity School undertook to clothe and teach forty children (25 male and 15 female) aged between 7 and 14, and apprentice them when their education was completed. In selecting pupils, the Trustees gave preference to orphans and those from large families. The children of those receiving poor relief were not eligible. In 1723 the school moved to its first permanent location on High Pavement in a handsome building opposite Garners Hill. The school moved again in 1853 to a building on the west side of Mansfield Road (near the junction with Woodborough Road), which is now the International Community Centre. The building was designed by T C Hine. The School is now located in far larger premises on Aspley Lane, which were opened in 1967. The new Post-16 Centre was opened in February 1997.

When taken over in the late 1990s it was a derelict, listed pre-Education Act (1870) school on the 'Buildings At Risk Register' and at risk of demolition. The restoration was supported by funding from ERDF, the Heritage Lottery Fund and the landfill tax. The project incorporated recycled materials, timber from managed sources, insulation, heat recovery systems, condensing boilers and low energy light fittings. It was later awarded Nottingham City Council Lord Mayor's Award for Conservation and Nottingham Civic Society Commendation.	1986	18_The_1980s	Best, Stephen J				Yes	S J Best	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	school education learning stone date brick	Buildings_and_Structures Schools_Colleges_and_Universities

On the left is the churchyard to Holy Trinity Church (which gave the name to Trinity Square, and is now the location of the multi-storey car park). In the distance is Trinity Church Schools at the corner of North Church Street. This picture shows the Mechanics Institution Hall. The Hall was 110 ft long, 59 ft wide and 40 ft high, It had a floor space of 8,400 sq ft. It was lit by 5 clusters of 81 gas jets. The balcony was fitted with easy cushioned stalls, and the ground floor with chairs. (See R Iliffe and W Baguley's book 'Victorian Nottingham', Vol 14). The Mechanics Institute stood at the junction of Milton Street, Burton Street and Trinity Square, opposite the old entrance to Victoria Station (now Victoria Centre) and the Victoria Station Hotel. It comprised of a group of buildings; The Mechanic's Institute large hall, a members refreshment room, a former Baptist Chapel built in a Romanesque style which was purchased by the Mechanics in 1912 and was known as The Queens Hall. Later the large hall became a cinema and was called Mechanics Pictures. (All these Victorian buildings have been demolished and replaced by Birkbeck House, a somewhat ugly 'modern' office block, which itself is again waiting for re-development. The Mechanics Institute was incorporated into this building.)	c 1857	09_Victorian_(1837-1901)	not known				Yes	Nottingham Historical Film Unit	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	school education learning institute mechanics hall street classical clock pilasters stone rusticated ashlar school children corner	Buildings_and_Structures Schools_Colleges_and_Universities People_and_Society Education Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Streetscene

Some of them are natural; others are artificial, but date back to prehistoric times, others again are mediaeval or even modern cellars. They have always been famous, and Asser, the friend and biographer of King Alfred, writing about 900, tells us that the ancient name for Nottingham was Tiuogobauc, which he translates as meaning ' the cave dwellings.' Later etchings and pictures show some caves with windows fixed in place used for habitation, whilst other caves were used for storage or brewing. These caves seen here were used for bottle storage under the reception area of the County Hotel. The hotel was demolished for the Theatre Royal extension.

It was built 1894-1898 as part of the new Great Central Railway, which ran from London Marylebone through Aylesbury, Rugby, Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield, linking up to the old Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. The first coal trains ran between London and Sheffield in 1898, and passenger travel followed in March 1899. The railway had changed its name to The Great Central Railway, and now the network ran from London in the south through the Midlands to the older network in the North between Lincoln, Grimsby, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool and Wrexham. In 1923, the GCR was grouped with the GER, GNR, NER, NBR and others to form the London North Eastern Railway, in 1948 British Railways was formed. Nottingham Victoria was towards the North of the city centre, and was built in a huge cavern below street level. Trains ran into the cavern through tunnels to the north (to Sheffield) and south (along the GCR main line to London, and via GNR lines at Weekday Cross Junction towards Grantham and Melton). The GCR line crossed the MR line and the Midland Station, before travelling south and crossing the River Trent at Wilford, next to the old toll bridge. The station building was red sandstone, and a handsome clocktower rose above the facade. Trains ran along the line until the Beeching axe closed it in 1969. Smaller stations closed in 1963, and the track south of Rugby was closed in 1966. Nottingham Victoria followed in 1967. The station was bulldozed and in its place built a shopping centre and underground multi-story carpark. The only part of the station that remains is the clock tower.

The construction was on a grand scale- around 700,000 cubic yards of sandstone rock was excavated from its cavernous site. Some 1300 houses and 24 public houses previously on the site had to be demolished. The site was approximately 13 acres big and 650 yards long from north to south. It had an average width of 110 yards with a tunnel at each end of it for access. Both the Great Central and Great Northern railways shared the station (they split into two lines at Weekday Cross junction) and this, after much argument, was why it was called Nottingham 'Victoria' rather than 'Central'. The main station building was in true Victorian splendour. It was constructed using the best quality faced bricks and Darley Dale stone with space out in front for Hackney carriages (would be a taxi rank now!) which was covered by a canopy. The three story building had a large 100 feet clock tower in it's centre topped with a cupola and weather vane. At the north end of the building access could be gained to the parcels office via two large metal gates. Inside the building, on the ground floor, you reached the spacious booking office. It was over 100ft long and 66ft wide and contained the best quality pine and a hard wearing oak floor along with a balcony to gain access to offices. The station itself had two large island platforms, each 1270 feet long, with four bays for local traffic giving a total of 12 platforms. Large steel pillars held up an enormous 3-part canopy - the two outer sections being 63 feet across the central one being 84 feet across. These were glazed and gave the station a very impressive 'cathedral' like look. The main station building was located on Milton Street along with the station hotel. The platforms both had very similar buildings with a variety of facilities including a telegraph office, refreshment rooms, toilets, many waiting rooms and even a ladies only tea room! The station boasted many facilities for the comfort of passengers - far more than many other stations in the area. A subway system, below track level, could be used for the movement of luggage in order to avoid carrying it over the footbridges. The station had passing loops round all platforms (for freight), two signal boxes and its own turntable. The two signal boxes were positioned at the north and south ends of the station and controlled entry and exit to the tunnels that allowed entry to the complex. The traffic that passed through was very varied. It included London-Manchester expresses, local services, cross-country services (from say York to Bristol via Oxford) as well as freight workings. As the station was shared with The Great Northern Railway (already well established when Victoria opened) a superb network of lines going to many destinations was available from the one station. In its hey-day it was a busy, friendly and grand station which many people loved and thought would last forever. But this was not to be. During the 1960's the whole Great Central route was being run down by diverting services away from it, cutting others and slowing down expresses to very slack timetables. Locomotives and rolling stock was unreliable and old- the line did not benefit from British Rail's new diesel locomotives. As passenger numbers fell, either going by car or other lines, closure seemed inevitable. The last through service from Nottingham to London ran on 3rd September 1966. All that was left was a DMU service between Nottingham and Rugby. Victoria station was finally closed on 4 September 1967 and demolished leaving only the clocktower to survive amongst the Victoria Shopping Centre and flats.

Nottingham Victoria was one of the main railway stations in Nottingham and was a splendid example of Victorian Railway Engineering. It was built 1894-1898 as part of the new Great Central Railway, which ran from London Marylebone through Aylesbury, Rugby, Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield, linking up to the old Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. The first coal trains ran between London and Sheffield in 1898, and passenger travel followed in March 1899. The railway had changed its name to The Great Central Railway, and now the network ran from London in the south through the Midlands to the older network in the North between Lincoln, Grimsby, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool and Wrexham. In 1923, the GCR was grouped with the GER, GNR, NER, NBR and others to form the London North Eastern Railway, in 1948 British Railways was formed. Nottingham Victoria was towards the North of the city centre, and was built in a huge cavern below street level. Trains ran into the cavern through tunnels to the north (to Sheffield) and south (along the GCR main line to London, and via GNR lines at Weekday Cross Junction towards Grantham and Melton). The GCR line crossed the MR line and the Midland Station, before travelling south and crossing the River Trent at Wilford, next to the old toll bridge. The station building was red sandstone, and a handsome clocktower rose above the facade. Trains ran along the line until the Beeching axe closed it in 1969. Smaller stations closed in 1963, and the track south of Rugby was closed in 1966. Nottingham Victoria followed in 1967. The station was bulldozed and in its place built a shopping centre and underground multi-story carpark. The only part of the station that remains is the clock tower.	c 1896-7	09_Victorian_(1837-1901)	not known				Yes	G Dennison	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	station tunnel victorian engineering railways cutting brick rails tracks tunnel houses crane digger steam shovel	Buildings_and_Structures Tunnels Transport_and_Communication Trains_and_Railways Buildings_and_Structures Construction_Renovation_and_Demolition

NTGM008545	86714	SK5740		52.95435674	-1.153011124	Nottingham	Milton Street	Victoria Railway Station - steam locomotive and platforms	Nottingham Victoria was one of the main railway stations in Nottingham. It was built 1894-1898 as part of the new Great Central Railway, which ran from London Marylebone through Aylesbury, Rugby, Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield, linking up to the old Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. The first coal trains ran between London and Sheffield in 1898, and passenger travel followed in March 1899. The railway had changed its name to The Great Central Railway, and now the network ran from London in the south through the Midlands to the older network in the North between Lincoln, Grimsby, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool and Wrexham. In 1923, the GCR was grouped with the GER, GNR, NER, NBR and others to form the London North Eastern Railway, in 1948 British Railways was formed. Nottingham Victoria was towards the North of the city centre, and was built in a huge cavern below street level. Trains ran into the cavern through tunnels to the north (to Sheffield) and south (along the GCR main line to London, and via GNR lines at Weekday Cross Junction towards Grantham and Melton). The GCR line crossed the MR line and the Midland Station, before travelling south and crossing the River Trent at Wilford, next to the old toll bridge. The station building was red sandstone, and a handsome clocktower rose above the facade. Trains ran along the line until the Beeching axe closed it in 1969. Smaller stations closed in 1963, and the track south of Rugby was closed in 1966. Nottingham Victoria followed in 1967. The station was bulldozed and in its place built a shopping centre and underground multi-story carpark. The only part of the station that remains is the clock tower.	1950's	15_The_1950s	not known				Yes	Nottingham Historical Film Unit	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	station victorian engineering railways people canopy steam locomotive train platforms signals waiting rooms interior	Transport_and_Communication Trains_and_Railways Buildings_and_Structures Transport

Nottingham Victoria station officially opened on the 24th May 1900- over a year after the start of main line services from London to Sheffield were passing through it. The construction was on a grand scale- around 700,000 cubic yards of sandstone rock was excavated from its cavernous site. Some 1300 houses and 24 public houses previously on the site had to be demolished. The site was approximately 13 acres big and 650 yards long from north to south. It had an average width of 110 yards with a tunnel at each end of it for access. Both the Great Central and Great Northern railways shared the station (they split into two lines at Weekday Cross junction) and this, after much argument, was why it was called Nottingham 'Victoria' rather than 'Central'. The main station building was in true Victorian splendour. It was constructed using the best quality faced bricks and Darley Dale stone with space out in front for Hackney carriages (would be a taxi rank now!) which was covered by a canopy. The three story building had a large 100 feet clock tower in it's centre topped with a cupola and weather vane. At the north end of the building access could be gained to the parcels office via two large metal gates. Inside the building, on the ground floor, you reached the spacious booking office. It was over 100ft long and 66ft wide and contained the best quality pine and a hard wearing oak floor along with a balcony to gain access to offices. The station itself had two large island platforms, each 1270 feet long, with four bays for local traffic giving a total of 12 platforms. Large steel pillars held up an enormous 3-part canopy - the two outer sections being 63 feet across the central one being 84 feet across. These were glazed and gave the station a very impressive 'cathedral' like look. The main station building was located on Milton Street along with the station hotel. The platforms both had very similar buildings with a variety of facilities including a telegraph office, refreshment rooms, toilets, many waiting rooms and even a ladies only tea room! The station boasted many facilities for the comfort of passengers - far more than many other stations in the area. A subway system, below track level, could be used for the movement of luggage in order to avoid carrying it over the footbridges. The station had passing loops round all platforms (for freight), two signal boxes and its own turntable. The two signal boxes were positioned at the north and south ends of the station and controlled entry and exit to the tunnels that allowed entry to the complex. The traffic that passed through was very varied. It included London-Manchester expresses, local services, cross-country services (from say York to Bristol via Oxford) as well as freight workings. As the station was shared with The Great Northern Railway (already well established when Victoria opened) a superb network of lines going to many destinations was available from the one station. In its hey-day it was a busy, friendly and grand station which many people loved and thought would last forever. But this was not to be. During the 1960's the whole Great Central route was being run down by diverting services away from it, cutting others and slowing down expresses to very slack timetables. Locomotives and rolling stock was unreliable and old- the line did not benefit from British Rail's new diesel locomotives. As passenger numbers fell, either going by car or other lines, closure seemed inevitable. The last through service from Nottingham to London ran on 3rd September 1966. All that was left was a DMU service between Nottingham and Rugby. Victoria station was finally closed on 4 September 1967 and demolished leaving only the clocktower to survive amongst the Victoria Shopping Centre and flats.

The construction was on a grand scale- around 700,000 cubic yards of sandstone rock was excavated from its cavernous site. Some 1300 houses and 24 public houses previously on the site had to be demolished. The site was approximately 13 acres big and 650 yards long from north to south. It had an average width of 110 yards with a tunnel at each end of it for access. Both the Great Central and Great Northern railways shared the station (they split into two lines at Weekday Cross junction) and this, after much argument, was why it was called Nottingham 'Victoria' rather than 'Central'. The main station building was in true Victorian splendour. It was constructed using the best quality faced bricks and Darley Dale stone with space out in front for Hackney carriages (would be a taxi rank now!) which was covered by a canopy. The three story building had a large 100 feet clock tower in it's centre topped with a cupola and weather vane. At the north end of the building access could be gained to the parcels office via two large metal gates. Inside the building, on the ground floor, you reached the spacious booking office. It was over 100ft long and 66ft wide and contained the best quality pine and a hard wearing oak floor along with a balcony to gain access to offices. The station itself had two large island platforms, each 1270 feet long, with four bays for local traffic giving a total of 12 platforms. Large steel pillars held up an enormous 3-part canopy - the two outer sections being 63 feet across the central one being 84 feet across. These were glazed and gave the station a very impressive 'cathedral' like look. The main station building was located on Milton Street along with the station hotel. The platforms both had very similar buildings with a variety of facilities including a telegraph office, refreshment rooms, toilets, many waiting rooms and even a ladies only tea room! The station boasted many facilities for the comfort of passengers - far more than many other stations in the area. A subway system, below track level, could be used for the movement of luggage in order to avoid carrying it over the footbridges. The station had passing loops round all platforms (for freight), two signal boxes and its own turntable. The two signal boxes were positioned at the north and south ends of the station and controlled entry and exit to the tunnels that allowed entry to the complex. The traffic that passed through was very varied. It included London-Manchester expresses, local services, cross-country services (from say York to Bristol via Oxford) as well as freight workings. As the station was shared with The Great Northern Railway (already well established when Victoria opened) a superb network of lines going to many destinations was available from the one station. In its hey-day it was a busy, friendly and grand station which many people loved and thought would last forever. But this was not to be. During the 1960's the whole Great Central route was being run down by diverting services away from it, cutting others and slowing down expresses to very slack timetables. Locomotives and rolling stock was unreliable and old- the line did not benefit from British Rail's new diesel locomotives. As passenger numbers fell, either going by car or other lines, closure seemed inevitable. The last through service from Nottingham to London ran on 3rd September 1966. All that was left was a DMU service between Nottingham and Rugby. Victoria station was finally closed on 4 September 1967 and demolished leaving only the clocktower to survive amongst the Victoria Shopping Centre and flats.

This area was shortly to become the site of the Victoria Centre multi-storey car park. Nottingham Victoria was one of the main railway stations in Nottingham. It was built 1894-1898 as part of the new Great Central Railway, which ran from London Marylebone through Aylesbury, Rugby, Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield, linking up to the old Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. The first coal trains ran between London and Sheffield in 1898, and passenger travel followed in March 1899. The railway had changed its name to The Great Central Railway, and now the network ran from London in the south through the Midlands to the older network in the North between Lincoln, Grimsby, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool and Wrexham. In 1923, the GCR was grouped with the GER, GNR, NER, NBR and others to form the London North Eastern Railway, in 1948 British Railways was formed. Nottingham Victoria was towards the North of the city centre, and was built in a huge cavern below street level. Trains ran into the cavern through tunnels to the north (to Sheffield) and south (along the GCR main line to London, and via GNR lines at Weekday Cross Junction towards Grantham and Melton). The GCR line crossed the MR line and the Midland Station, before travelling south and crossing the River Trent at Wilford, next to the old toll bridge. The station building was red sandstone, and a handsome clocktower rose above the facade. Trains ran along the line until the Beeching axe closed it in 1969. Smaller stations closed in 1963, and the track south of Rugby was closed in 1966. Nottingham Victoria followed in 1967. The station was bulldozed and in its place built a shopping centre and underground multi-story carpark. The only part of the station that remains is the clock tower.	1972	17_The_1970s	Baker, Reg				Yes	Reg Baker	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	victorian engineering railways cutting tunnel station houses factory wasteground	Transport_and_Communication Trains_and_Railways Buildings_and_Structures Transport Buildings_and_Structures Construction_Renovation_and_Demolition

NTGM008777	30725	SK5740		52.95435674	-1.153011124	Nottingham	Milton Street	Sherwood Foresters leaving Victoria Station	The Cardwell reforms of 1881 brought together the 45th and 95th Regiments of Foot with the Militia of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire plus the volunteer regiments of the two counties, to form The Sherwood Foresters (Derbyshire Regiment). It is of interest that it was not until 1902 that Nottinghamshire was added to the title. The Regiment now consisted of: 1st Battalion (45th), 2nd Battalion (95th), 3rd (late Derbyshire Militia) and 4th (late Royal Sherwood Foresters) Militia Battalions, and 1st and 2nd (Derbyshire) and 3rd and 4th (Nottinghamshire) Volunteer Battalions. The Headquarters of the Regimental District was established in Derby. The 2nd Battalion saw active service in Egypt during 1882 and later went on to India. In 1888 they took part in the Sikkim Expedition to Tibet, and in 1897 they were once again on active service in the Tirah Expedition where Lieutenant H. S. Pennell won the VC during the capture of the Dargai Heights. The outbreak of the Boer War in 1899 found both regular battalions in Malta and during November of that year the 1st Battalion sailed for South Africa where they were to remain until the end of the War in 1902. They took part in most of the major battles and shared all the hard marching and privations of that long campaign. On one occasion they marched 400 miles in 45 days and were engaged with the enemy 28 times. The 4th Battalion and service companies of the Volunteer Battalions also took part in the campaign with great credit. The 2nd Battalion, still stationed in Malta, provided volunteers for the many mounted infantry companies. VCs were won by Cpl H Beet and Pte W Bees, while amongst the many other decorations bestowed on Foresters were no fewer than twenty-two Distinguished Conduct Medals. The growing threat of War with Germany at the beginning of the Century caused a further reorganisation of the Army. In 1908 the 3rd and 4th Battalions became part of the Special Reserve with liabilities for overseas service, whilst the Volunteer Battalions became the 5TH, 6th, 7th (Robin Hoods) and 8th Battalions of The Sherwood Foresters in the newly formed Territorial Force, later renamed the Territorial Army. The History of the Regiment in the First World War is very much the story of the men of the counties of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. When War was declared, The Sherwood Foresters consisted of eight Battalions and a depot at Derby. During the War the Regiment expanded to a maximum of 33 Battalions, of whom 20 served overseas. Altogether some 140,000 men, nearly all from Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, served in the Regiment.

St Peter's Church spire is inbetween. The city at this time still had the appearance of a large market town. The houses were bound within a restricted area due to a ring of fields and meadows around the city, used by the burgesses of freeholders of the City to graze their animals (The Nottingham Enclosure Act of 1845 enclosed these fields and meadows, and compensated them for the loss of open space used for housing development, and allotted space for a series of places of public recreation and public walks). The city, as it is seen here, has not yet developed its late Georgian and Victorian boom in the industrial economy, with its associated increase in population and cramped squalid housing. This scene is a pastoral one with water (?) in the foreground.	1860	09_Victorian_(1837-1901)			Rock and Co, London		Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	castle rock cliff people fashion city view churches river meadows fields pasture cityscape	Buildings_and_Structures Castles_and_Forts Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Cityscape

During the late 1800's it was the Shakespeare Temperance Hotel (see NTGM004475), it was then occupied by architects, builders, surgeons, a corn merchant and had been used as a music school and a dispensary (there is a sign on the right side of the building which says that it is being used as a dispensary at the time that this picture was taken. It also says that there is a clinic for chest diseases, free on Tuesdays and Fridays 6.30pm, run by H Harper MD of South Regent Street).

NTGM009186	37960	SK5740		52.95435674	-1.153011124	Nottingham	Milton Street - Mansfield Road - Trinity Square junction	The Great Anniversary meeting of the Reformation Society - 6 February 1847 - Mechanics Institute - interior	This meeting was held at the Mechanics Institute in Nottingham. Machanics Institutes became common in most towns of Britain and the United States between 1820 and 1860 for the voluntary education of skilled manual workers. Ideally such an institute was to have a library, a museum, a laboratory, public lectures about applied science, and courses in various skills, but few had all of these. They were places where artisans could learn, part-time, the basic principles of science, particularly mechanics, physics and chemistry. Mechanics Institutes were also used as exhibition centres and meeting places for clubs in the Sciences as well as the Arts. The crowded event seen here was for the Reformation Society's anniversary. At this time there were great popular movements for political reform, but the group seen here were not celebrating for that cause, but rather for the Protestant Reformation (there are many flags hanging around the room with anti-Catholic slogans). In our secular age and the general decline in interest in religious or spiritual matters most people would now be hard pressed to define Protestantism or its place in our history. It's basic precepts was that religion should be based on the individual, not on the authority of a Church. Protestants believe that you are saved by your faith alone - if you are truly sorry for the sins you have committed in your earthly life, then you will be admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven. Protestants believe in the authority of the Holy Bible as God's written and holy word: the scriptures are open to individual interpretation, but man-made traditions or dogmas should not be placed on a par with its teachings. Protestantism, then, paved the way for the liberal ideas of freedom of the individual conscience. Basing life on the individual may seem an unremarkable idea today, but it was an enormous change in the days when western Europe was governed under the absolute authority of monarchs in civic affairs and the Roman Catholic Church in spiritual matters. As consequence Protestants were often hideously persecuted. In England, perhaps because the initial break with the Roman Catholic Church occurred for cynical reasons (i.e. - King Henry VIII demands for a divorce), the impact the Reformation had on our society has often been greatly understated. Although Henry VIII himself was fairly religiously conservative, many of his appointees, such as Archbishop Thomas Cranmer and the Lord Chancellor Thomas Cromwell, were confirmed religious radicals, who used their positions to advance the Reformation of the Church of England. Other Bishops such as Hugh Latimer, Nicholas Ridley and John Hooper also advanced the cause during the early years of the Reformation during the reigns of King Henry VIII and the boy King Edward VI. (King Henry VIII died in 1547, and the anniversary seen here could be the 300 years since that date.)	6 February 1847	09_Victorian_(1837-1901)		McCallum, A	Hullmandel and Walton		Yes	Nottingham Historical Film Unit	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	institute mechanics people celebration event protestant Reformation Society Anniversary meeting crowds dinner tables fashion interior religion religious group	Buildings_and_Structures Schools_Colleges_and_Universities People_and_Society Education Events Celebrations Events Religious People_and_Society Fashion

The balcony was fitted with easy cushioned stalls, and the ground floor with chairs. (See R Iliffe and W Baguley's book 'Victorian Nottingham', Vol 14). The Mechanics Institute stood at the junction of Milton Street, Burton Street and Trinity Square, opposite the old entrance to Victoria Station (now Victoria Centre) and the Victoria Station Hotel. It comprised of a group of buildings; The Mechanic's Institute large hall, a members refreshment room, a former Baptist Chapel built in a Romanesque style which was purchased by the Mechanics in 1912 and was known as The Queens Hall. Later the large hall became a cinema and was called Mechanics Pictures. (All these Victorian buildings have been demolished and replaced by Birkbeck House, a somewhat ugly 'modern' office block, which itself is again waiting for re-development. The Mechanics Institute was incorporated into this building.)	1853	09_Victorian_(1837-1901)			not known	Rock and Co	Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	church religion worship christian anglican street schools education museum mechanics institute spire pinnacles buttresses rose window rusticated people	Buildings_and_Structures Religious_Buildings Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Streetscene Buildings_and_Structures Museums_and_Galleries Buildings_and_Structures Schools_Colleges_and_Universities

There are two periods of fortification in Nottingham's long history. In 926 Edward the Elder, Alfred the Great's warlike son, captured Nottingham from the Danes. He built a bridge across the Trent and fortified the town. The lines of his defences run, more or less along Bridlesmith-gate, Victoria-street, Goose-gate, Hockley, Fisher-gate, Hollow Stone, High Pavement, and Middle Pavement. The market of this little town was at Weekday Cross, and the church stood on the site of St. Mary's. That was all there was of Nottingham till the Conquest. After the establishment of Nottingham Castle the French followers of Peveril settled in a suburb round the Castle which became known as the French Borough, and was ruled under different laws to those which obtained in the older or English Borough. The whole town was burnt in 1141 during King Stephen's reign, and when Henry II. came to the throne in 1154 he encouraged the townsfolk to build another and much more extensive fortification than the Edward the Elder defence. Starting at Postern-street, the line of this defence is roughly down Park Row, Parliament Street, St. John's Street, Count Street, Carter Gate, Fisher Gate, Hollow Stone, High, Middle and Low Pavement, Lister Gate, Walnut Tree Lane.

Band leader Cyril Stapleton was born on Jan. 31, 1914, at Mapperley, Nottingham and died on Feb. 28, 1974 in London (heart attack before waking). At age seven, Cyril began studying the violin, and, at age 12, made his first broadcast from 5NG, the local radio station in Nottingham. He was often heard on broadcasts from the BBC Studios in Birmingham, but while still very young, he went to Czechoslovakia in order to study under Sevcik, the famous Czech violin teacher. While still a teenager, he found work playing in cinema 'pit orchestras' accompanying silent films. At age 17, he won a Trinity College of Music (London) scholarship. While still a student, he found work playing in the Henry Hall Dance Band, just formed for BBC broadcasts. He was with the band on their first ever broadcast, and can be heard playing on some of Hall's early Columbia 78s recorded in 1932. At some point, Cyril left Hall and he returned to Nottingham, and again found work in the local cinemas. He next joined the Jack Payne Orchestra, and was a member when the band toured to South Africa. And, again was heard on some of Payne's 1936 Rex label recordings (78rpm). When that job ended, Cyril formed his own band in London, where he found work at The Casino (Compton Street), and also at Fisher's Restaurant (New Bond Street). In 1939, he made his very first broadcast with his own band. He also played briefly with the Jack Hylton Orchestra, under Billy Ternent. With the start of WWII, his musical career came to an abrupt halt when he enlisted in the Royal Air Force as an air gunner. He soon was organizing music for Camp shows and concerts at various military stations. During this time, he visited New York City. During his final year of RAF service (he served for a total of five years) he became a member of the RAF Symphony Orchestra then playing in Uxbridge. Upon his Service discharge, he followed a career in 'Classical' music, and at one time, was a member of three orchestras: the London Symphony, the National Symphony and the Philharmonia Orchestra. In 1947, for whatever reasons, found him back in London again playing at Fisher's Restaurant with his own band. (One of his vocalists was a young Dick James, who later became music publisher for The Beatles.) Stapleton's band was also heard on late night broadcasts. In 1948, he added a string section, and his work on such radio shows as 'Your Hit Parade' and 'Golden Slipper' brought him wider fame. In 1952, the 'BBC Dance Orchestra' became the 'BBC Show Band', and Cyril Stapleton became the leader. The Show Band was also seen in some early BBC Telecasts, further increasing Stapleton's fame. The first broadcast was heard on October 2, 1952. Robert Farnon arranged the band's signature tune, which opened to the words: 'Just For You... '. As the BBC's prestige Pop music orchestra, the band attracted both top British stars, and American entertainers such as Frank Sinatra and Nat 'King' Cole. In late 1955, a second Show Band film 'Just For You' (CinemaScope, directed by Michael Carreras, Odeon Cinema circuit) appeared. In 'The Story of a Starry Night' section, Stapleton was the featured violin soloist, and further on also accompanied Joan Regan on piano. On June 28, 1957, the BBC announced a decision to end the band. Cyril then formed his own group with which he toured and appeared at venues all over the UK, until the mid-'60s when be became Artists and Repertoire Manager for Pye Records. Near the end of his life, he was again touring with his own big band, and even recorded some LPs. Sadly he died at only 59 years of age. Over the years, many of the unknown youngsters who guested with the band, went on to stardom in their own right, including such names as singer Matt Monro, pianist Bill McGuffie (who later had his own orchestra), Rikki Fulton, Stan Stennett, and Tommy Whittle.

The Arboretum was opened to the public May 11, 1852. It comprised seventeen acres, and presents within itself a landscape, Aviary, a People's Park, and an ornamental Garden. The Nottingham Enclosure Act 1845 enclosed fields and meadows, used by the burgesses of freeholders of the City to graze their animals, and to compensate for the loss of open space used for recreation, allotted space for a series of places of public recreation and public walks. One hundred and thirty acres made up of Queen's Walk and Queen's Walk Park, Victoria Park, Robin Hood Chase, Corporation Oaks, St Ann's Hill Avenue, Nottingham Arboretum (seen here), the General Cemetery, Waterloo Promenade, the Church Cemetery and the Forest were created as public open spaces from the enclosures. The following account was reported in a newspaper about the opening ceremony:- 'OPENING OF THE NOTTINGHAM ARBORETUM. On Tuesday this long-anticipated festival took place at Nottingham. A procession was formed at two o'clock, in the Market-place, in front of the Exchange, and marched up Clumber-street and Mansfield-road to the top entrance, and thence round the entire grounds, in the following order :- The 'pinders,' in livery of green turned up with silver lace; the Enclosure Commissioners; magistrates; bellman and sheriff's officers in livery, bearing small silver maces;' the Mayor's sergeant in scarlet gown, bearing the large gold mace; the Mayor (Mr. W. Felkin), supported by Mr. Ball, the sheriff of the borough, and the town clerk, in their robes of office, the clerk to the magistrates, magistrates, aldermen, common councilmen, bearing wands; auditors and assessors, citizens, four abreast; South Nottinghamshire Yeomanry band; citizens, four abreast; the North Leicester Yeomanry band, including part of the band of the Duke of Rutland; citizens; the Campanalogian band; citizens. Having perambulated the walks of the entire area, about 18 acres, the Mayor addressed the vast multitude, alluding to the progress making for the benefit of the people in every branch of science, and specially referring to the rapidly-improving position of the town of Nottingham up to the present time. The townspeople had but 300 acres for public recreation; but by an act of Parliament passed in 1845, they have gained the present Arboretum. The Mayor was loudly cheered at the conclusion of his I address. The National Anthem was then sung, three times three cheers given for the Queen, and three for Mr. Felkin, and the multitude broke into groups, and devoted the remainder of the afternoon and evening to dancing, promenading the walks, listening to the music, singing. A juvenile band of fifers and drummers was a source of considerable amusement and attraction. At six o'clock the corporation and principal inhabitants dined together in the Exchange hall. The Arboretum, has been most judiciously laid out. From near the principal entrance lodge stretches a miniature lake, stocked with a variety of British aquatic birds. The grounds are tastefully planted with trees and shrubs, whose botanical names it is intended to indicate by labels. The beautifully undulating greensward has been levelled in places for dancing; and handsome refreshment rooms have been built, where, however, fermented drinks have been interdicted (ie no alcohol). The Arboretum is gratuitously open three days of the week. On Tuesday there was an immense number of visitors from the Midland and Northern Counties, from Birmingham and the Potteries, from Lancashire and the West Riding, as well as from the surrounding districts.'	1852	09_Victorian_(1837-1901)			Dorrington		Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	park garden arboretum lodge entrance leisure recreation gateposts gable bargeboards bay finial chimneys balcony ogee	Leisure_and_Recreation Parks_and_Gardens

The Church was built in 1841 and formed as a parish in 1842. The church originally had this tall spire seen here, which was later removed. It was demolished circa 1957-8. The site is now occupied by the Trinity Square Car Park. The old Mechanics Institute is in the centre of the picture. The Hall was 110 ft long, 59 ft wide and 40 ft high, It had a floor space of 8,400 sq ft. It was lit by 5 clusters of 81 gas jets. The balcony was fitted with easy cushioned stalls, and the ground floor with chairs. (See R Iliffe and W Baguley's book 'Victorian Nottingham', Vol 14). The Mechanics Institute stood at the junction of Milton Street, Burton Street and Trinity Square, opposite the old entrance to Victoria Station (now Victoria Centre) and the Victoria Station Hotel. It is seen here in its original form, next to the Baptist Chapel. It comprised later of a group of buildings; The Mechanic's Institute large hall, a members refreshment room, and then incorporated the former Baptist Chapel built in a Romanesque style which was purchased by the Mechanics in 1912 and was known as The Queens Hall. Later the large hall became a cinema and was called Mechanics Pictures. (All these Victorian buildings have been demolished and replaced by Birkbeck House, a somewhat ugly 'modern' office block, which itself is again waiting for re-development. The new Mechanics Institution was incorporated into this building.)	1853	09_Victorian_(1837-1901)			Newman and Co	Howitt, J	Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	church religion worship christian baptist victorian anglican street schools education museum mechanics institute spire pinnacles buttresses rose window rusticated people barrow horse carriage architecture	Buildings_and_Structures Religious_Buildings Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Streetscene Buildings_and_Structures Museums_and_Galleries Buildings_and_Structures Schools_Colleges_and_Universities

Picture Drawn by the Architect A Waterhouse RA (1830-1905) Alfred Waterhouse was the son of wealthy mill-owning quaker parents. Born in Liverpool, he was educated at the quaker Grove School in Tottenham (Middlesex). Apprenticed as an architect to Richard Lane, he spent much of his youth travelling throughout Europe and studied in France, Italy and Germany. Upon his return to England, Alfred set up his own architectural practice in Manchester. During his twelve years there, his skills were in great demand, especially for the many new public buildings that the city authorities commissioned in the High Victorian era. For Waterhouse's dozen staff were able to produce large quantities of high-quality drawings with both speed and efficiency. He won the competition to build the Assize Courts in 1859 and other buildings soon followed: the original Owens Park Building (now the University of Manchester), Strangeways Prison, the Refuge Assurances Building (now the Palace Hotel) and the National Provincial Bank. He also erected fine buildings for the City of Liverpool, such as the Lime Street Station Hotel (1868-71). The most notable of Waterhouse's Northern structures, however, was the new Manchester Town Hall (1868-77). Here, a triangular site called for innovative and original ideas, the difficulties of which only Waterhouse's clever design were able to overcome. The result is the striking Neo-Gothic Building of today, always admired by the general public as well as the architectural community. Eventually, Waterhouse moved south to London, where he designed the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors off Parliament Square and the Guilds' College in South Kensington (Middlesex). He became most renowned, however, for the magnificent Natural History Museum (1873-81), also in South Kensington. This modified Romanesque style building is notable for its pioneering revival of terra-cotta - used on the facing in yellow, red and light blue - brought about by Alfred's concern for hard wearing surface materials. He also created a number of Oxbridge Colleges - Balliol College (Oxford) and Pembroke College (Cambridge) - and Prudential Assurance Buildings, such as those in Holborn, Southampton and Leeds. Financially speaking, Waterhouse was probably the most successful of all Victorian architects. His planning skills were recognised at an early stage, but appreciation of his stylistic achievements has taken longer. Influenced by both Ruskin and Pugin, as well as the more practical approach of George Gilbert Scott, he developed his own slant on the composition of forms and a predilection for simple bold ornamentation to equal the growing scale of his designs. Though expert within Gothic and free Renaissance styles and having a preference for the Neo-Romanesque, Waterhouse did not limit himself to a single architectural look. He made a distinction between moulded or carved ornamentation on plain stone and naturally decorative materials, like veined marble, which he usually left unembellished. Such sensitive treatment of materials verged upon the aspirations of the Arts and Crafts Movement, but he always acknowledged construction as an industrial process. His buildings have characteristically bold and picturesque outlines and sound planning, with especial awareness of the urban skyline. Amongst his many honoured positions, he was President of the Royal Institute of British Architects from 1888 to 1891. Though a most prolific architect, best known for his large scale public and commercial buildings, Waterhouse was also a furniture designer and painter and built many smaller domestic buildings. For example, his own residences: Barcombe Cottage (at Fallowfield in Manchester 1864), Foxhill House (at Whiteknights in Earley, Berkshire 1868) and Yattendon Court (also in Berkshire 1877). This latter county was his home in his later years and he was well known for designing such local buildings as the town halls in both Reading and Wokingham. He erected a second house on the Whiteknights estate - Whiteknights House - for his father and was much involved with the adjoining school of Leighton Park. He eventually died in Yattendon in 1905.	28 August 1897	09_Victorian_(1837-1901)		Waterhouse, A		The Builder - 28 August 1897	Yes	F W Stevenson	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	street road offices people fashion clothing insurance spires turrets gables traffic hill victorian commerce architecture design	Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Streetscene Buildings_and_Structures Offices

Fothergill Watson (he later changed his name to Watson Fothergill) was one of the leading local architects practising in the Nottingham area from about 1870 to 1906. During these thirty or so years he designed over a hundred buildings including houses, banks, churches, shops and warehouses, many of which still survive today. He worked in the Gothic revival and Old English vernacular styles, very popular in the Victorian times. These styles were loosely based on medieval churches and castles, and 16th &amp; 17th century tudor buildings. This building dates from 1895.	6 May 1898	09_Victorian_(1837-1901)	Bedford Lemere and Co				Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	street shop business lamp horse coach carriage gable finial fothergill oriel	Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Streetscene Buildings_and_Structures Shops_Banks_and_Commercial

The workers and Mr Morley travelled to Nottingham from Mansfield by train on the 26th of June. They disembarked onto the platform to be bombarded with stones hurled by a crowd of angry rival supporters (rumoured to have been stirred up by Robert Clifton). The incident developed into a riot as a running battle between the two groups rampaged through Nottingham. The 83rd Infantry Regiment were called in to restore order. Samuel Morley won the election. This view shows the windows of Paget and Morley's Committee Rooms, St Ann's ward, broken by crowds on 26 June 1865.

On several occasions they were called out in support of the civil powers to quell civilian unrest, most notably the Luddite, Chartist and Reform riots. Other than these disturbances the period until 1900 was occupied with training, which the Regiment became acknowledged as one of the finest Yeomanry Cavalry Regiments of the time.

The AA's 100 members in 1905 grew to 83,000 by 1914. In 1906 the AA began erecting the country's first effective danger and warning signs and continued to be responsible for all signposting until the early 1930s, when it became a local authority responsibility. The AA Members' Special Handbook first appeared in 1908, giving details of AA appointed agents and repairers throughout the UK.

In 1865, the new Theatre Royal was completed. It took just six months to build at a cost of &amp;pound;15,000.

The Theatre Royal is now regarded as one of the best touring venues in the country, attracting major touring dramas, opera, ballet, West End musicals and, of course, an annual pantomime.

NTGM010316		SK5740		52.95435674	-1.153011124	Nottingham	Mansfield Road ?	Nottingham Brewery Offices, Nottingham	The Nottingham Brewery was situated at 52/56 Mansfield Road where York House now stands. The origins of the Brewery can be traced back to at least 1847 when James Long was listed as an East India and Pale Ale Brewer on the site. He sold the business in 1875 and after passing through several ownerships it was purchased in 1879 by Edward Wheeler Field. The brewery became a registered company in 1887 at which time it was recorded as owning many public houses of which several are still standing (including the Sir Charles Napier on South Sherwood Street and The Plough in Radford). Beneath the brewery immense sandstone cellars were used as an excellent storage location for beers as the temperature never rose above an ideal 56 degrees fahrenheit. In 1887, the premises were completely rebuilt to make it one of the best equipped in the country. Wm Bradford of Carlton Chambers in London designed the handsome new building in a Grecian style. Overall the site occupied 21,000 sq ft. Nottingham Brewery soon established itself as the City's main brewery, serving fine ales to local citizens from its expanding estate of public houses. It also gained world-wide acclaim for transporting its gold medal winning India Pale Ale to troops of the British Empire across the globe. The brewery continued to flourish through the first half of the twentieth century but was sadly sold to Tennant Brothers Ltd of the Exchange Brewery, Sheffield in 1944 along with 150 pubs. Bottling at the site ceased in 1948 and brewing stopped later in May 1952. On 15 June 1956 the Nottingham Brewery Company was formally wound up. Whitbread later owned the site, before it was demolished in the early 1960's and a large concrete office block (York House) was built here.

It took just six months to build at a cost of &amp;amp;pound;15,000. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;It was the work of C.J Phipps, a 29 year old architect who went on to become one of Victorian Britain&amp;amp;#39;s leading theatre designers. The Classic facade and Corinthian columns still dominate Nottingham&amp;amp;#39;s city centre skyline. &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;One of the most luxurious theatres of its day, the Theatre Royal provided opulent surroundings for the boom of music hall and variety, the birth of light opera, exciting new drama, touring opera and, by the twenties and thirties, the best Hollywood-style musicals and pantomimes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Empire Theatre of Varieties opened alongside in 1898 on the site of the Theatre Royal&amp;amp;#39;s old dressing rooms. Backstage facilities were so closely interwoven that it was not unknown for an actor to leave his dressing room and end up on the wrong stage! &amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;By the late 1960&amp;amp;#39;s the Theatre Royal had become run down and had a reputation for some of the worst backstage conditions in the country. In 1969, the city council bought it and set about restoring the theatre to its former glory. In 1978 the Theatre Royal reopened, boasting elegant and airy foyers and bars, a 1,186 seat auditorium beautifully restored in Victorian style green and gilt decor and with fully comprehensive and technically upgraded backstage facilities. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Theatre Royal is now regarded as one of the best touring venues in the country, attracting major touring dramas, opera, ballet, West End musicals and, of course, an annual pantomime. The Theatre Royal&amp;amp;#39;s success after its renovation paved the way for the Royal Centre&amp;amp;#39;s second phase, the construction of a state-of-the-art Concert Hall on the site of the old Empire.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;	c 1925	12_The_1920s				Spree	Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	theatre statue corinthian columns stone arches street furniture cars transport cinema pub inn	Buildings_and_Structures Entertainment_and_Sports Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Streetscene Transport_and_Communication Motor_Vehicles

NTGM010387		SK5740		52.95435674	-1.153011124	Nottingham	Bluecoat Street - Mansfield Road	The Bluecoat School	The Bluecoat School was founded in 1706 by Timothy Fenton, rector of St Peter's Church (1705-21), and the incumbents of the two other Nottingham parishes, St Mary's and St Nicholas'. It was Nottingham's first elementary school which educated both sexes free of charge. It took its name from the blue uniforms provided for the pupils from 1725 (before this date the clothes were grey in colour). The movement to set up charity schools began in the late seventeenth century as an attempt to combat crime and un-Christian behaviour. It sought to provide schooling for the children of the poor in 'pious instruction and education in the knowledge and practice of true religion'. The school was funded by voluntary subscription. After an initial meeting on 27 February 1706 to gain subscribers to the venture, the school opened on 1 May 1707, not at the building seen here, but possibly in a house loaned for the purpose in St Mary's Gate. The Nottingham Charity School undertook to clothe and teach forty children (25 male and 15 female) aged between 7 and 14, and apprentice them when their education was completed. In selecting pupils, the Trustees gave preference to orphans and those from large families. The children of those receiving poor relief were not eligible. In 1723 the school moved to its first permanent location on High Pavement in a handsome building opposite Garners Hill. The school moved again in 1853 to a building on the west side of Mansfield Road (near the junction with Woodborough Road) seen here, which is now the International Community Centre. The School has now re-located yet again to far larger premises on Aspley Lane, which were opened in 1967.	c 1900's-10's ?	10_Edwardian_(1901-1910)	not known				Yes	L Cripwell	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	school victorian charity gables turrets clock corner road junction cables post children people bellcote arched mullion windows buttressed trees education	Buildings_and_Structures Schools_Colleges_and_Universities Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Streetscene

When Anderson died in 1796 he left all the money he had to found Anderson's College. Birkbeck worked as professor of natural philosophy at the college but eventually moved to London where he founded the London Mechanics Institute. The publication of Observations Upon the Education of the People (1825) by Henry Brougham helped to popularize these institutions. These self-improving working men's adult education colleges were often funded by wealthy local industrialists. Mechanics Institutes became common in most towns of Britain and the United States between 1820 and 1860 for the voluntary education of skilled manual workers. Ideally such an institute was to have a library, a museum, a laboratory, public lectures about applied science, and courses in various skills, but few had all of these. They were places where artisans could learn, part-time, the basic principles of science, particularly mechanics, physics and chemistry.

(the date given for this picture was September 1913, but was more likely to be September 1914)	This picture is one of a series showing mobilised troops in Nottingham. (See NTGM010532- NTGM010535). The date given was September 1913, but very little seems to have been going on with the Sherwood Foresters at that time. The 1st Battalion was in India, and the Chesterfield battalion were at a camp at Clumber. These pictures mostly show troops being watched by large crowds and families, which usually suggests that they are about to go off to war, so a more likely date for the pictures would be September 1914 and the start of World War 1. When War was declared, The Sherwood Foresters only consisted of eight Battalions and a depot at Derby. During the War the Regiment expanded to a maximum of 33 Battalions, of whom 20 served overseas. Altogether some 140,000 men, nearly all from Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire, served in the Regiment. The 2nd Battalion was part of the British Expeditionary Force, which landed in France in September 1914, and went straight into the bitter fighting on the Aisne. On 20th September (the anniversary of the Battle of Alma - a previous Battle Honour of the 95th), the Battalion carried out a counter attack to plug a gap in the British lines. The casualties were almost identical with those at Alma, 17 out of 22 officers and 214 out of 930 other ranks. Reinforced, the 2nd Battalion fought another major battle in October at Ennettiere on the way to Ypres, holding a vastly superior German force for 48 hours and losing in the process 16 officers and 710 other ranks. The 1st Battalion was in India at the outbreak of War. It was brought home, and sent to France in November 1914 without any chance of adjusting itself to European conditions and as a result suffered badly in its first four winter months of 'Trench War'. The Battalion took part in two of the major battles in 1915 - Neuve Chapelle and Loos, and suffered severe casualties. Pte. J. Rivers and Cpl. J. Upton were awarded VCs for bravery. Both 1st and 2nd Battalions continued to serve in France until after the Armistice on 11th November 1918, and overall were the most heavily committed of all the battalions of the Regiment. The 3rd and 4th Militia Battalions were embodied at the outbreak of War but remained in the UK as holding and reinforcement units. The Territorial Army was immediately mobilised on the outbreak of War, and the original four Sherwood Foresters Territorial Battalions, the 5th, 6th, 7th (Robin Hoods) and 8th, formed the 139 (Forester) Infantry Brigade in the 46 (North Midland) Division. In September the Territorial Army was doubled and almost overnight the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th (Robin Hoods) and 2/8th Battalions of the Regiment were formed from the original Battalions, and were made up into the 178 (Forester) Infantry Brigade of 59th (North Midland) Division.

In September the Territorial Army was doubled and almost overnight the 2/5th, 2/6th, 2/7th (Robin Hoods) and 2/8th Battalions of the Regiment were formed from the original Battalions, and were made up into the 178 (Forester) Infantry Brigade of 59th (North Midland) Division.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;	September 1913 (or 1914 ?)	11_The_1910s	not known				Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	station victorian railways cars people street men troops soldiers war WW1crowds families uniforms	Military War Military Army_Barracks_and_Regiments People_and_Society Families_and_Children

In 1870 the chapel was sold to the Catholic Apostolic Church, who remained there until 1951 when it was purchased by the Roman Catholic Church and dedicated on 15 October 1951 for the use of Ukranian Catholics. The building was demolished in 1970. (information from 'In every generation' by R C Swift) The Catholic Apostolic Church (sometimes called the 'Irvingites') was a remarkable body of Christians gathered together under apostolic rule from out of the various Western Churches and looking for the imminent Second Coming of Christ. In readiness for the Apocalypse, twelve new 'apostles', were appointed by ministers of seven churches at a solemn ceremony in London in 1835. These churches had come into being when a number of 'charismatic' congregations, including Rev Edward Irving's, had been expelled from their parent bodies. Initially the congregations under apostles carried on with their former traditions of worship. There was a call, however, for liturgical expression of the fullness of the Church's witness. Thus elaborate and beautiful liturgical services were devised, to replace former forms of worship. Their liturgy was derived mainly from the Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Anglican Churches. A large number of clergy were required for each church, organised in four divisions, an 'angel' ( a role similar to that of a bishop), six elders, seven prophets and at least seven deacons. A prophetically inspired decision not to replace apostles who died led to a schism in Germany and the eventual formation of a separate body known as 'The New Apostolic Church', which remains in existence today. The deaths of the apostles as the years passed guaranteed the eventual demise of the main body, since they had reserved to themselves the authority to ordain to the traditional major orders: the episcopate (known as angels), priesthood and deacons. Thus, with the death of the one surviving apostle in 1901, such ordinations ceased and services were curtailed. The last angel died in 1960 and the last priest in 1971. All Catholic Apostolic sacramental ministrations therefore ceased from that time.

NTGM010703	1639	SK5740		52.95435674	-1.153011124	Nottingham	Park Street - Friar Lane	Theosophical Hall - Chapel	On Wednesday, May 30, 1792, at Friar Lane Baptist Chapel, Nottingham, William Carey delivered an epoch-making sermon based on Isaiah 54:2-3: 'Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes. For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left; and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited'. In this sermon, Carey called on his Baptist colleagues to enlarge its tent through missionary outreach to the 'heathen' (which, at the time this was said, was the rather pompous and racist view of anyone who wasn't a Christian, and which, today, is not a term endorsed or acceptable to the compilers of this web-site).

Over 200 years ago, the Theatre Royal was envisaged by two Nottingham lace dressers, William and John Lambert, as a 'temple of drama'...a place of 'innocent recreation and of moral and intellectual culture'. In 1865, the new Theatre Royal was completed. It took just six months to build at a cost of &amp;pound;15,000. It was the work of C.J Phipps, a 29 year old architect who went on to become one of Victorian Britain's leading theatre designers. The Classic facade and Corinthian columns still dominate Nottingham's city centre skyline. One of the most luxurious theatres of its day, the Theatre Royal provided opulent surroundings for the boom of music hall and variety, the birth of light opera, exciting new drama, touring opera and, by the twenties and thirties, the best Hollywood-style musicals and pantomimes. The Empire Theatre of Varieties opened alongside in 1898 on the site of the Theatre Royal's old dressing rooms. Backstage facilities were so closely interwoven that it was not unknown for an actor to leave his dressing room and end up on the wrong stage! By the late 1960's the Theatre Royal had become run down and had a reputation for some of the worst backstage conditions in the country. In 1969, the city council bought it and set about restoring the theatre to its former glory. In 1978 the Theatre Royal reopened, boasting elegant and airy foyers and bars, a 1,186 seat auditorium beautifully restored in Victorian style green and gilt decor and with fully comprehensive and technically upgraded backstage facilities. The Theatre Royal is now regarded as one of the best touring venues in the country, attracting major touring dramas, opera, ballet, West End musicals and, of course, an annual pantomime.	6 June 1978	17_The_1970s	Lloyd, Edgar				Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	royal theatre entertainment princess plaque ceremony unveiling	Events Royal_Occasions Buildings_and_Structures Entertainment_and_Sports Events Ceremonies

He soon proved himself to be not only industrious, but having great energy, combined with capacity for management, and this, guided by deep religious convictions. In 1840 he became the virtual head of the London business and when his uncle Richard and cousin Arthur died, he became the sole managing partner. More than 40 years before Old Age Pensions were adopted he devised a system for his aged workpeople whereby he allowed each of them 6 shillings a week, without work, and other retiring allowances cost him over &amp;pound;2,000 per year. He took an active part in promoting elementary education, always insisting on simple Bible teaching. He was elected MP for Nottingham, but was unseated through the illegal activities of two zealous friends. He was MP for Bristol from 1868 to 1885. He served on the London School Board from 1870 to 1876. He was a generous benefactor to public charities and religious institutions. In 1885 Prime Minister Gladstone wrote to Samuel Morley, at Queen Victoria's command, offering him a peerage - the next day Morley replied that he sincerely valued Her Majesty's kindness but begged respectfully to decline the proposal. In later years he became wide in his sympathies and broad in his politics. He died in 1886 and at his funeral there were deputations from 97 institutions and associations with which he was connected. There is a statue of him in Parliament Street.

Further Troops were subsequently formed in Holme Pierrepont, Bingham, Wollaton and Watnall, with five Troops being regimented as 'The Southern Regiment of Nottinghamshire Yeomanry' in 1826. On several occasions they were called out in support of the civil powers to quell civilian unrest, most notably the Luddite, Chartist and Reform riots. Other than these disturbances the period until 1900 was occupied with training, which the Regiment became acknowledged as one of the finest Yeomanry Cavalry Regiments of the time.

NTGM012073		SK5740		52.95435674	-1.153011124	Nottingham	Theatre Square - Upper Parliament Street	The Theatre Royal	Over 200 years ago, the Theatre Royal was envisaged by two Nottingham lace dressers, William and John Lambert, as a 'temple of drama'...a place of 'innocent recreation and of moral and intellectual culture'. In 1865, the new Theatre Royal was completed (the was an existing theatre in the Lace Market called The Theatre Royal). It took just six months to build at a cost of &amp;pound;15,000. It was the work of C.J Phipps, a 29 year old architect who went on to become one of Victorian Britain's leading theatre designers. The Classic facade and Corinthian columns still dominate Nottingham's city centre skyline. One of the most luxurious theatres of its day, the Theatre Royal provided opulent surroundings for the boom of music hall and variety, the birth of light opera, exciting new drama, touring opera and, by the twenties and thirties, the best Hollywood-style musicals and pantomimes. The Empire Theatre of Varieties opened alongside in 1898 on the site of the Theatre Royal's old dressing rooms. Backstage facilities were so closely interwoven that it was not unknown for an actor to leave his dressing room and end up on the wrong stage! By the late 1960's the Theatre Royal had become run down and had a reputation for some of the worst backstage conditions in the country. In 1969, the city council bought it and set about restoring the theatre to its former glory. In 1978 the Theatre Royal reopened, boasting elegant and airy foyers and bars, a 1,186 seat auditorium beautifully restored in Victorian style green and gilt decor and with fully comprehensive and technically upgraded backstage facilities. The Theatre Royal is now regarded as one of the best touring venues in the country, attracting major touring dramas, opera, ballet, West End musicals and, of course, an annual pantomime.

It originally house the public library, University College, technical and trade schools, and the Natural History Museum (now in Wollaton Hall). From its foundation in 1881, the University College came under the authority of the Nottingham Corporation and the College's management committee was controlled by the Town Council. (In 1906-1908 D H Lawrence was a student at the University College.) The University re-located to its present site between Lenton, Dunkirk and Beeston in 1928. In August 1948, the University College received the royal charter granting full University status and the power to confer its own degrees (prior to this date students at Nottingham received degrees from the University of London). Parts of the old University College buildings were then used as Nottingham Central Library before becoming what is today part of Nottingham Trent University.

NTGM012462	83569-1	SK5740		52.95435674	-1.153011124	Nottingham,_Sneinton	Bath Street	Grave of William Thompson (Bendigo), St Mary's Burial Ground, 1987	Bendigo was Nottingham's famous Bare-knuckle fighter. Bare-knuckle fighting was ever popular during the free-wheeling days of the late 18th to mid 19th centuries and the only rules that governed these prize-fights had been drawn up in 1743 by a Thames waterman called Jack Broughton. These remained the only written rules for over a century. They stated that a round lasted for no set length of time, but ended when a fighter was knocked down or thrown to the ground by wrestling. Once floored, the fallen fighter had thirty seconds to come up to the 'scratch,' a marker set in the centre of the ring. During the bout, no fighter was allowed to take a respite, and would be instantly disqualified if he 'fell without taking a blow.' These contests became a war of attrition, often developing into a form of grappling match as the combatants became bruised and tired. Nottingham's famous bare-knuckle fighter who is celebrated by not only having a public house named after him (see NTGM003606, now renamed the Hermitage) was William Abednego Thompson (1811-1880), better known as 'Bendigo.' Bendigo was among the last of the great prize-fighters and was perhaps, the champion of all. His fans were many, and included such respected members of society as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who even penned a verse to the fighter entitled 'Bendigo's Sermon.' Bendigo's upbringing, like that of many of the fighters of the period, had not been easy. At the age of fifteen, following the death of his father, he was sent to the Nottingham Workhouse. Though he didn't remain there long, he was to experience the terrible harshness of life in poverty, vowing never to return. Having tried his hand at oyster selling on the streets of the city he took up a trade as an iron turner, thus developing his muscular physique. But prize-fighting was to become Bendigo's main occupation and by the age of 21 he had successfully defeated a number of local men. Bendigo loved to taunt his opponents as they fought by making faces at them or composing impromptu rhymes at their expense. Such asides made him a crowd pleaser and his contests were often witnessed by upwards of 15,000 spectators. In February 1839 he met the fearsome 'Deaf' James Burke in a fight for the championship of all-England at Heather in Leicestershire. Within half-an-hour Burke was well-beaten. In a fit of temper he resorted to head-butting his much younger 'southpaw' challenger - thus losing the contest by being disqualified for foul-play. Bendigo's last fight was on the 5th June 1850, against a young Redditch man called Tom Paddock. A fight that the champion was to win in the 49th round following a foul by his opponent. Up until that point though the fight had been too close to call and Bendigo, now in his fortieth year, decided to quit the ring. During his later years he became a Methodist preacher and though illiterate he had his own way of delivering a sermon. Adopting a boxer's stance he would point to the hard-earned trophies by his side and address his audience with the following words: 'See them belts, see them cups, I used to fight for those. But now I fight for Christ.' Bendigo died on 23rd August 1880 seven weeks after falling down the stairs of his home in Beeston, his grave is marked by a stone in the Bath Street Gardens (a former burial ground in Nottingham) where it is the only memorial not to have been moved.	1987	18_The_1980s	Best, S J				Yes	S J Best	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	bendigo boxer man memorial stone grave lion sculpture park gardens trees grass	Buildings_and_Structures Monuments_Memorials_and_Crosses Buildings_and_Structures Cemeteries_and_Graveyards

The accompanying article (from Nottingham Guardian, 23.10.1916) reads; There was a brief but pleasing ceremony in front of the Guildhall, Nottingham yesterday at the close of the City Special Constables' parade at St. Mary's Church, when the Mayor (Councillor J G Small presented a local non-commissioned officer with the Distinguished Conduct Medal, which has been awarded him for gallantry, and with a long service and good conduct medal. The non-commissioned officer in question was Sergeant Major A. E. Spowage, R.A.M.C., who was born at Ilkeston, but lived in Nottingham from infancy until after he had reached man's estate. He was chief dispenser at the King George V Hospital at Dublin when war broke out, and mobilising with the 14th Field Ambulance, 5th Division, went to France in August 1914, was in the engagement at Mona, and for services rendered during the retreat was recommended for the French Military Medal of the Legion of Honour. In October he was mentioned in despatches by Sir John French, and in March 1915 was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. 'For gallantry and good work throughout the campaign, especially at Jury, where he displayed great zeal and devotion to duty in attendance in the wounded under shell fire between September 23rd and September 30th, 1914.' Sergeant Major Spowage chanced to be on five days leave in Nottingham - he is due to return today - and it was arranged that the medal to which he was entitled should be presented to him publicly. The Mayor was accompanied by the Sheriff (Councillor J Clarkson), by Auld. Sir John McCraith, Ald. J T Spalding and by Mr H S Whitby, and the special constables, nearly 500 strong, were drawn up in front of the Guildhall. 'You are engaged', said the Mayor to the Sergeant-Major, 'with many millions of your comrades and their allies, in endeavouring to restore peace to the world. In front of us are many of your fellow countrymen who are engaged in the preservation of peace at home. It is fitting I think that on each an occasion we should allow ourselves to congratulate one, who has earned distinction for himself and honour for his city, and publicly present him with the rewards which he has so deservedly gained.' To the accompaniment of rousing cheers, the Mayor pinned the medal on the recipients uniform and Sergeant Major Spowage, in the course of a brief reply said that while he keenly appreciated the honour which has been done to him, there were thousands of his comrades who equally deserved it. It has been said that the R.A.M.C. had a good time of the base and did not go anywhere near the firing line, but if he could show them of the losses they had suffered, they would realise that was a totally mistaken impression. The proceedings closed with three cheers for the mayor.	22 October 1916	11_The_1910s	Not Known				Yes	Nottingham City Council	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	man war doctor first world portrait pose award fashion hat medals clothes mayor official men steps guildhall top hat cane moustache women beard uniform red cross chain	People_and_Society Portraits Military War People_and_Society Fashion Events Awards_and_Presentations

Born in Philadelphia of Nottingham emigres, and orphaned at the age of four, he came to England with his younger sister Maria and lived for a short while with his grandparents in Mount Street. In 1868 age 14 he enrolled in the Government School of Art. On the 1871 census he is described as a lace curtain designer, and in 1872 he was awarded the 'Queen's Prize for a Design of a Lace Curtain'. Other prizes followed and in 1877 he was again awarded the Queen's Prize, this time for the design for a damask table Cloth. Hammond was an indefatigable worker, and soon began to use his skills as a draftsman to record aspects of the changing town. He began showing his work at local venues in 1882 and in 1890 exhibited for the first time at the Royal academy. His real hobby was black and white sketching in charcoal. He drew about 350 pictures all together mainly scenes of a Nottingham he knew but which has largely passed away today. Extracted from 'The Changing Face of Tom Hammond's Nottingham' by John Beckett which is the introductory essay in 'A City in the Making Drawings of Tom Hammond'. Mansfield Road used to be called the 'Way to York', and the summit where St. Andrew's Church now stands was said by the old stage-coachmen to be the most bitter and exposed point of their long run. On this summit, close to the present entrance to the Church Cemetery, was the gallows of the town, and along Mansfield Road the wretched criminals condemned by the terrible laws of the time were conducted to execution. The district was called 'Gallows Hill', but rather more than a hundred years ago its name was changed to 'Mars Hill' out of deference to the wishes of the local inhabitants. On the left of Mr. Hammond's picture we have a portion of the facade of the Mechanics Institute. This was built in 1845 on the site of a hamlet called 'Burton Leys', whose name is reflected in the modern 'Burton Street'. On the opposite side of the road is the opening into Charlotte Street, a thoroughfare completely cleared away in constructing the Victoria Station. Milton Street from the end of which this picture is drawn was formerly called 'Boot Lane', and the lower part of Mansfield Road between Charlotte Street and Woodborough Road was known as 'Melbourne Street'.

Charlotte Street has now completely disappeared, although its site is marked by the foot bridge leading over the Victoria Station. It was not one of the old streets of the town, and was named after, Queen Charlotte (the wife of George III) who was extremely popular in Nottingham, owing to the sympathy aroused by her persecution (note from Picture the Past: it was actually Queen Caroline, wife of George IV, and not Queen Charlotte who suffered this persecution). It commenced opposite the modern Shakespeare Street, which was anciently called &amp;amp;#39;Cross Lane&amp;amp;#39;, and which was one of the muddiest and foulest lanes of the district. Somewhere in Cross Lane stood the Jews&amp;amp;#39; Gallows, for no self respecting Christian criminal would condescend to be executed upon the same gallows as that which was used to terminate the existence of a Jew. Charlotte Street led through to Glasshouse Street, of which there is little to say, and was not a particularly salubrious thoroughfare, For some reason, it was generally referred to as &amp;amp;#39;Charlotter Street&amp;amp;#39; which is a curious example of our vernacular. Mr. Hammond&amp;amp;#39;s drawing is interesting as a reminder of the time and dress to be seen about the streets of Nottingham a generation ago, and it is astonishing to think, when one looks at this picture, that it is now necessary to have a policeman stationed at the point from which it is drawn to direct and control the traffic.

Born in Philadelphia of Nottingham emigres, and orphaned at the age of four, he came to England with his younger sister Maria and lived for a short while with his grandparents in Mount Street. In 1868 age 14 he enrolled in the Government School of Art. On the 1871 census he is described as a lace curtain designer, and in 1872 he was awarded the 'Queen's Prize for a Design of a Lace Curtain'. Other prizes followed and in 1877 he was again awarded the Queen's Prize, this time for the design for a damask table Cloth. Hammond was an indefatigable worker, and soon began to use his skills as a draftsman to record aspects of the changing town. He began showing his work at local venues in 1882 and in 1890 exhibited for the first time at the Royal academy. His real hobby was black and white sketching in charcoal. He drew about 350 pictures all together mainly scenes of a Nottingham he knew but which has largely passed away today. Extracted from 'The Changing Face of Tom Hammond's Nottingham' by John Beckett which is the introductory essay in 'A City in the Making Drawings of Tom Hammond'. Cur Lane is just outside the defences of mediaeval Nottingham, and may possibly occupy the site of the old town ditch. It runs parallel to Coalpit Lane, which was constructed towards the close of the eighteenth century as an easy gradient for the carriage of coal from the Wollaton pits. Even today the trees in Portland Place give to Cur Lane a singularly rural aspect, and remind us that until about 1730, the Sherwin family had a notable cherry orchard in this neighbourhood. The Black Lion Inn in Portland Place, was the rendezvous of the caucus which governed Nottingham years ago, and within its walls they unofficially decided upon the names of Mayor and Sheriff. Cur Lane runs into St. John's Street, and just about that juncture is the site of the pottery, where in the eighteenth century Morley produced his beautiful Nottingham brown ware.

Extracted from 'The Changing Face of Tom Hammond's Nottingham' by John Beckett which is the introductory essay in 'A City in the Making Drawings of Tom Hammond'. Hollow Stone as a thoroughfare is not as ancient as some of our other roads. Before wheeled traffic was in general use, the road through Nottingham running from the south of England to the north, passed along Narrow Marsh and up Drury Hill, but in later times, when wheels were generally used, a fresh thoroughfare was made, which came up the steep hill to St. Mary's Church, passed along the Pavements and joined the old road at the top of Drury Hill. The ascent to St. Mary's Church was hollowed out of the rock and hence its name 'Hollow Stone'. It has been reconstructed and modified in comparatively modern times, but still retains some of its interesting associations and features. At its foot, just where it joins Plumptre Square, stood one of the gateways through the defences of the town, erected by Henry II about 1154, and there are still traces of some of the rock hewn chambers, which were used by the guards of this gateway. In the middle of this picture, where the road turns to the right, stands an uninteresting looking modern front to an old building. This is the public house with the strange title of 'Horne's Castle'. William Andrew Horne was an old reprobate, but a man of considerable wealth who pursued his evil courses until he reached the ripe age of seventy-four, when Nemesis overtook him and he was arraigned for a murder which he had committed some twenty years before. In 1759 he was convicted and sentenced to death. He was driven from his own house - this Horne's Castle - to the gallows, which stood near to the site of St. Andrew's Church, by his own coachman in his own carriage. He expressed no contrition for his many misdeeds, but was much chagrined because the authorities refused to allow him to eat a plum pudding; for he had been accustomed to have a plum pudding at twelve o'clock on his birthday for many years, and the authorities had fixed upon his birthday as the day of his execution and refused to allow him to live until after twelve o'clock. On the right of the picture, at the end of Short Hill, is a fine gabled Tudor house, which was used during the last century as a school house, but is now occupied for commercial purposes.

He drew about 350 pictures all together mainly scenes of a Nottingham he knew but which has largely passed away today. Extracted from 'The Changing Face of Tom Hammond's Nottingham' by John Beckett which is the introductory essay in 'A City in the Making Drawings of Tom Hammond'. This is a delightful drawing that shows another phase of Mr. Hammond's genius. His treatment of the six great Corinthian columns with the details of their capitals and the delicate workmanship of the entablature over them is a very fine achievement. The Theatre Royal was built in 1865, at a cost of &amp;pound;15,000, on part of the old Sand Field of the town and was opened by a pantomime 'The House that Jack Built'. Previous to 1865 the only theatre in Nottingham was in St. Mary's Gate. This building, which still remains, was erected in 1760 by a man called Whitely, the proprietor of one of the stock companies by which the theatrical business of England was then conducted; it was closed in 1867, but was immediately re-opened as a concert hall. It is interesting to see the old stage door and scenery entrance to this building - they are still to be found in Halifax Place - and to remember that within its walls Handel's 'Judas Maccabaeus', 'Samson' and 'The Messiah' were first introduced to Nottingham. The drawing shows us a flight of pigeons; one of the interesting features of Nottingham is its pigeons, which congregate upon the Castle Rock, round the Theatre Royal and at the top of Victoria Street. They are exceedingly tame, though perhaps not so tame as their brethren who live upon St. Paul's Cathedral, London.

Extracted from 'The Changing Face of Tom Hammond's Nottingham' by John Beckett which is the introductory essay in 'A City in the Making Drawings of Tom Hammond'. Parliament Street, which occupies the centre of this drawing, was called 'The Back Side' until about 1770, and throughout its whole length is an extremely wide thoroughfare. The reason for this width is that the town wall of Henry the Second's time extended along the ground which is now the middle of the street. Within this wall was a lane, used as a mustering place and a thoroughfare, and when eventually the wall was pulled down, this lane, the site of the wall, and the wide ditch on its outer side, were thrown into one, and so we got the open space which is of such value to-day. Near the centre of the picture stands a market stall which is almost opposite the end of Clumber Street - formerly called 'Cow Lane' - and here stood one of the town gateways known as 'Cow Lane Bar', or sometimes 'North Gate'. Opposite this gateway, near the spot where the policeman now directs traffic, stood the old Maypole of Nottingham, which was not done away with until the end of the eighteenth century. The Coach and Horses Tavern on the right of the drawing was an interesting old Restoration house, built, as its curved gables show, about the same time as the house next to Marshal Tallard's (Newdigate House) in Castle Gate. It had a vesical window, very similar to that still existing in the Royal Children Inn, (so called from the family of Queen Anne who was married to the Prince of Denmark, and who took refuge in Nottingham for a short time in 1688, just before her father James I lost his throne). The 'Coach and Horses' was pulled down about the year 1890: it is interesting to remember that the ground floor was two steps below the street level, showing that in Parliament Street, as in other parts of the town, the ground level had been considerably raised by the accumulation of debris during the two centuries after this tavern was built.

Born in Liverpool, he was educated at the quaker Grove School in Tottenham (Middlesex). Apprenticed as an architect to Richard Lane, he spent much of his youth travelling throughout Europe and studied in France, Italy and Germany. Upon his return to England, Alfred set up his own architectural practice in Manchester. During his twelve years there, his skills were in great demand, especially for the many new public buildings that the city authorities commissioned in the High Victorian era. For Waterhouse&amp;amp;#39;s dozen staff were able to produce large quantities of high-quality drawings with both speed and efficiency. He won the competition to build the Assize Courts in 1859 and other buildings soon followed: the original Owens Park Building (now the University of Manchester), Strangeways Prison, the Refuge Assurances Building (now the Palace Hotel) and the National Provincial Bank. He also erected fine buildings for the City of Liverpool, such as the Lime Street Station Hotel (1868-71). The most notable of Waterhouse&amp;amp;#39;s Northern structures, however, was the new Manchester Town Hall (1868-77). Here, a triangular site called for innovative and original ideas, the difficulties of which only Waterhouse&amp;amp;#39;s clever design were able to overcome. The result is the striking Neo-Gothic Building of today, always admired by the general public as well as the architectural community. Eventually, Waterhouse moved south to London, where he designed the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors off Parliament Square and the Guilds&amp;amp;#39; College in South Kensington (Middlesex). He became most renowned, however, for the magnificent Natural History Museum (1873-81), also in South Kensington. This modified Romanesque style building is notable for its pioneering revival of terra-cotta - used on the facing in yellow, red and light blue - brought about by Alfred&amp;amp;#39;s concern for hard wearing surface materials. He also created a number of Oxbridge Colleges - Balliol College (Oxford) and Pembroke College (Cambridge) - and Prudential Assurance Buildings, such as those in Holborn, Southampton and Leeds. Financially speaking, Waterhouse was probably the most successful of all Victorian architects. His planning skills were recognised at an early stage, but appreciation of his stylistic achievements has taken longer. Influenced by both Ruskin and Pugin, as well as the more practical approach of George Gilbert Scott, he developed his own slant on the composition of forms and a predilection for simple bold ornamentation to equal the growing scale of his designs. Though expert within Gothic and free Renaissance styles and having a preference for the Neo-Romanesque, Waterhouse did not limit himself to a single architectural look. He made a distinction between moulded or carved ornamentation on plain stone and naturally decorative materials, like veined marble, which he usually left unembellished. Such sensitive treatment of materials verged upon the aspirations of the Arts and Crafts Movement, but he always acknowledged construction as an industrial process. His buildings have characteristically bold and picturesque outlines and sound planning, with especial awareness of the urban skyline. Amongst his many honoured positions, he was President of the Royal Institute of British Architects from 1888 to 1891. Though a most prolific architect, best known for his large scale public and commercial buildings, Waterhouse was also a furniture designer and painter and built many smaller domestic buildings. For example, his own residences: Barcombe Cottage (at Fallowfield in Manchester 1864), Foxhill House (at Whiteknights in Earley, Berkshire 1868) and Yattendon Court (also in Berkshire 1877). This latter county was his home in his later years and he was well known for designing such local buildings as the town halls in both Reading and Wokingham. He erected a second house on the Whiteknights estate - Whiteknights House - for his father and was much involved with the adjoining school of Leighton Park. He eventually died in Yattendon in 1905.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;	1973	17_The_1970s	Brownlow, L				Yes	L Brownlow	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	street road offices people fashion clothing insurance spires turrets gables traffic hill victorian commerce architecture design corner arch buses transport	Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views Streetscene Buildings_and_Structures Offices

It was Nottingham&amp;amp;#39;s first elementary school which educated both sexes free of charge. It took its name from the blue uniforms provided for the pupils from 1725 (before this date the clothes were grey in colour). The movement to set up charity schools began in the late seventeenth century as an attempt to combat crime and un-Christian behaviour. It sought to provide schooling for the children of the poor in &amp;amp;#39;pious instruction and education in the knowledge and practice of true religion&amp;amp;#39;. The school was funded by voluntary subscription. After an initial meeting on 27 February 1706 to gain subscribers to the venture, the school opened on 1 May 1707, possibly in a house loaned for the purpose in St Mary&amp;amp;#39;s Gate. The Nottingham Charity School undertook to clothe and teach forty children (25 male and 15 female) aged between 7 and 14, and apprentice them when their education was completed. In selecting pupils, the Trustees gave preference to orphans and those from large families. The children of those receiving poor relief were not eligible. In 1723 the school moved to its first permanent location on High Pavement in a handsome building opposite Garners Hill. The school moved again in 1853 to a building on the west side of Mansfield Road (near the junction with Woodborough Road), which is now the International Community Centre. The building was designed by T C Hine. The School is now located in far larger premises on Aspley Lane, which were opened in 1967. The new Post-16 Centre was opened in February 1997. The sculptor of the statue pictured was J Stonehouse of St Anne&amp;amp;#39;s.(information from www.stpetersnottingham.org)&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;	c 2000?	20_2000_Onwards	Oldfield, Geoffrey				Yes	Geoffrey Oldfield	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	school education learning ashlar statue sculpture niche charity stone crest carved boy figure costume pupil steps drain arched doorway entrance	Buildings_and_Structures Schools_Colleges_and_Universities

Extracted from &amp;amp;#39;The Changing Face of Tom Hammond&amp;amp;#39;s Nottingham&amp;amp;#39; by John Beckett which is the introductory essay in &amp;amp;#39;A City in the Making Drawings of Tom Hammond&amp;amp;#39;. The comer of Market Street and Parliament Street as it appeared in 1890 reminds us of the great changes that have come over Nottingham during the last thirty years. The scene here presented to us by Mr. Hammond has something of the bucolic about it and might be looked for in a small country town. Nobody could accuse the Theatre Square of having anything rural to show now-a-days! Until seventy or eighty years ago the northern exits from the Great Market Place must have been extraordinarily inconvenient. There was the main route through Chapel Bar and there was the route through Clumber Street, but the latter would be much occupied by the coach traffic which centred on the Blackamore&amp;amp;#39;s Head Inn, then standing at the corner of High Street and Pelham Street and the White Lion Inn in Clumber Street, which has come down to our own times as the &amp;amp;#39;Lion Hotel&amp;amp;#39;. For the rest there were many narrow passages branching off from Long Row, some of them still remaining, which wandered through a wilderness of small tenements till they emerged into Parliament Street. One of these thoroughfares was rather more roomy and convenient than its neighbours, it even went so far as to admit of wheeled traffic, our fathers knew it as &amp;amp;#39;Sheep Lane&amp;amp;#39;, but before their day it was called &amp;amp;#39;Organ Lane&amp;amp;#39;. Out of this &amp;amp;#39;Sheep Lane&amp;amp;#39; the modern &amp;amp;#39;Market Street&amp;amp;#39; was evolved. It was ready for traffic in 1865 and on the 2nd October of that year Alderman Page, the Mayor of Nottingham at the time, after opening the Goose Fair proceeded to the foot of the new street and declared that its name was and should be &amp;amp;#39;Theatre Street&amp;amp;#39;. Time, however, belied this statement and the name of &amp;amp;#39;Theatre Street&amp;amp;#39; was abandoned for the more dignified &amp;amp;#39;Market Street&amp;amp;#39;.

On this summit, close to the present entrance to the Church Cemetery, was the gallows of the town, and along Mansfield Road the wretched criminals condemned by the terrible laws of the time were conducted to execution. The district was called &amp;amp;#39;Gallows Hill&amp;amp;#39;, but rather more than a hundred years ago its name was changed to &amp;amp;#39;Mars Hill&amp;amp;#39; out of deference to the wishes of the local inhabitants. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the left of Mr Hammond&amp;amp;#39;s picture we have a portion of the facade of the Mechanics Institute. This was built in 1845 on the site of a hamlet called &amp;amp;#39;Burton Leys&amp;amp;#39;, whose name is reflected in the modern &amp;amp;#39;Burton Street&amp;amp;#39;. On the opposite side of the road is the opening into Charlotte Street, a thoroughfare completely cleared away in constructing the Victoria Station. Milton Street from the end of which this picture is drawn was formerly called &amp;amp;#39;Boot Lane&amp;amp;#39;, and the lower part of Mansfield Road between Charlotte Street and Woodborough Road was known as &amp;amp;#39;Melbourne Street&amp;amp;#39;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Descriptive text taken from &amp;amp;#39;Nottingham Past and Present&amp;amp;#39;, published in 1926.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thomas William Hammond 1854-1935.

On this summit, close to the present entrance to the Church Cemetery, was the gallows of the town, and along Mansfield Road the wretched criminals condemned by the terrible laws of the time were conducted to execution. The district was called &amp;amp;#39;Gallows Hill&amp;amp;#39;, but rather more than a hundred years ago its name was changed to &amp;amp;#39;Mars Hill&amp;amp;#39; out of deference to the wishes of the local inhabitants. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;On the left of Mr Hammond&amp;amp;#39;s picture we have a portion of the facade of the Mechanics Institute. This was built in 1845 on the site of a hamlet called &amp;amp;#39;Burton Leys&amp;amp;#39;, whose name is reflected in the modern &amp;amp;#39;Burton Street&amp;amp;#39;. On the opposite side of the road is the opening into Charlotte Street, a thoroughfare completely cleared away in constructing the Victoria Station. Milton Street from the end of which this picture is drawn was formerly called &amp;amp;#39;Boot Lane&amp;amp;#39;, and the lower part of Mansfield Road between Charlotte Street and Woodborough Road was known as &amp;amp;#39;Melbourne Street&amp;amp;#39;. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Descriptive text taken from &amp;amp;#39;Nottingham Past and Present&amp;amp;#39;, published in 1926.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Thomas William Hammond 1854-1935. Born in Philadelphia of Nottingham emigres, and orphaned at the age of four, he came to England with his younger sister Maria and lived for a short while with his grandparents in Mount Street. In 1868 age 14 he enrolled in the Government School of Art. On the 1871 census he is described as a lace curtain designer, and in 1872 he was awarded the &amp;amp;#39;Queen&amp;amp;#39;s Prize for a Design of a Lace Curtain&amp;amp;#39;. Other prizes followed and in 1877 he was again awarded the Queen&amp;amp;#39;s Prize, this time for the design for a damask table Cloth.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Hammond was an indefatigable worker, and soon began to use his skills as a draftsman to record aspects of the changing town.

It was built 1894-1898 as part of the new Great Central Railway, which ran from London Marylebone through Aylesbury, Rugby, Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield, linking up to the old Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway. The first coal trains ran between London and Sheffield in 1898, and passenger travel followed in March 1899. The railway had changed its name to The Great Central Railway, and now the network ran from London in the south through the Midlands to the older network in the North between Lincoln, Grimsby, Sheffield, Manchester, Liverpool and Wrexham. In 1923, the GCR was grouped with the GER, GNR, NER, NBR and others to form the London North Eastern Railway, in 1948 British Railways was formed. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Nottingham Victoria was towards the North of the city centre, and was built in a huge cavern below street level. Trains ran into the cavern through tunnels to the north (to Sheffield) and south (along the GCR main line to London, and via GNR lines at Weekday Cross Junction towards Grantham and Melton). The GCR line crossed the MR line and the Midland Station, before traveling south and crossing the River Trent at Wilford, next to the old toll bridge. The station building was red sandstone, and a handsome clocktower rose above the facade. Trains ran along the line until the Beeching axe closed it in 1969. Smaller stations closed in 1963, and the track south of Rugby was closed in 1966. Nottingham Victoria followed in 1967. The station was bulldozed and in its place built a shopping centre and underground multi-story carpark. The only part of the station that remains is the clock tower. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;	Summer 1968	16_The_1960s	Beilby, Bernard				Yes	Bernard Beilby	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	site building demolition multi-storey car park shopping centre Victoria railway train station buildings industrial offices shops earth waste-ground tower spire	 Construction_Renovation_and_Demolition Buildings_and_Structures Transport Offices Factories_and_Industrial Trains_and_Railways Transport_and_Communication

It was Nottingham&amp;amp;#39;s first elementary school which educated both sexes free of charge. It took its name from the blue uniforms provided for the pupils from 1725 (before this date the clothes were grey in colour). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The movement to set up charity schools began in the late seventeenth century as an attempt to combat crime and un-Christian behaviour. It sought to provide schooling for the children of the poor in &amp;amp;#39;pious instruction and education in the knowledge and practice of true religion&amp;amp;#39;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The school was funded by voluntary subscription. After an initial meeting on 27 February 1706 to gain subscribers to the venture, the school opened on 1 May 1707, not at the building seen here, but possibly in a house loaned for the purpose in St Mary&amp;amp;#39;s Gate. The Nottingham Charity School undertook to clothe and teach forty children (25 male and 15 female) aged between 7 and 14, and apprentice them when their education was completed. In selecting pupils, the Trustees gave preference to orphans and those from large families. The children of those receiving poor relief were not eligible. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 1723 the school moved to its first permanent location on High Pavement in a handsome building opposite Garners Hill. The school moved again in 1853 to a building on the west side of Mansfield Road (near the junction with Woodborough Road), which is now the International Community Centre. The School has now re-located yet again to far larger premises on Aspley Lane, which were opened in 1967.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;	1995	19_The_1990s	Beilby, Bernard				Yes	Bernard Beilby	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	victorian mullion school yard clock chain gable brickwork mullioned stone windows	 Clocks_and_Clock_Towers Buildings_and_Structures Schools_Colleges_and_Universities

It was the work of C.J Phipps, a 29 year  old architect who went on to become one of Victorian Britain&amp;amp;#39;s leading  theatre designers. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Classic facade and Corinthian columns still  dominate Nottingham&amp;amp;#39;s city centre skyline. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;One of the most luxurious  theatres of its day, the Theatre Royal provided opulent surroundings for  the boom of music hall and variety, the birth of light opera, exciting  new drama, touring opera and, by the twenties and thirties, the best  Hollywood-style musicals and pantomimes. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The Empire Theatre of Varieties  opened alongside in 1898 on the site of the Theatre Royal&amp;amp;#39;s old  dressing rooms. Backstage facilities were so closely interwoven that it  was not unknown for an actor to leave his dressing room and end up on  the wrong stage! &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;By the late 1960&amp;amp;#39;s the Theatre Royal had become run  down and had a reputation for some of the worst backstage conditions in  the country and so in 1969, the city council bought it and set about restoring  the theatre to its former glory. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 1978 the Theatre Royal reopened,  boasting elegant and airy foyers and bars, a 1,186 seat auditorium  beautifully restored in Victorian style green and gilt decor and with  fully comprehensive and technically upgraded backstage facilities. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The  Theatre Royal is now regarded as one of the best touring venues in the  country, attracting major touring dramas, opera, ballet, West End  musicals and, of course, an annual pantomime. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;	before 1898	09_Victorian_(1837-1901)	Not Known				Yes	Bernard Beilby	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	theatre royal Corinthian columns stone carvings statue samuel morley cobbles pediment square classic facade posts arched keystone cornice bar public house rusticated	 Entertainment_and_Sports  Buildings_and_Structures  Music_and_Performances  Leisure_and_Recreation  Art_and_Sculpture  Streetscene  Natural_World_Landscape_and_Views

Born in Liverpool, he was educated at the quaker Grove School in Tottenham (Middlesex). Apprenticed as an architect to Richard Lane, he spent much of his youth travelling throughout Europe and studied in France, Italy and Germany. Upon his return to England, Alfred set up his own architectural practice in Manchester. During his twelve years there, his skills were in great demand, especially for the many new public buildings that the city authorities commissioned in the High Victorian era. For Waterhouse&amp;amp;amp;#39;s dozen staff were able to produce large quantities of high-quality drawings with both speed and efficiency. He won the competition to build the Assize Courts in 1859 and other buildings soon followed: the original Owens Park Building (now the University of Manchester), Strangeways Prison, the Refuge Assurances Building (now the Palace Hotel) and the National Provincial Bank. He also erected fine buildings for the City of Liverpool, such as the Lime Street Station Hotel (1868-71). The most notable of Waterhouse&amp;amp;amp;#39;s Northern structures, however, was the new Manchester Town Hall (1868-77). Here, a triangular site called for innovative and original ideas, the difficulties of which only Waterhouse&amp;amp;amp;#39;s clever design were able to overcome. The result is the striking Neo-Gothic Building of today, always admired by the general public as well as the architectural community. Eventually, Waterhouse moved south to London, where he designed the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors off Parliament Square and the Guilds&amp;amp;amp;#39; College in South Kensington (Middlesex). He became most renowned, however, for the magnificent Natural History Museum (1873-81), also in South Kensington. This modified Romanesque style building is notable for its pioneering revival of terra-cotta - used on the facing in yellow, red and light blue - brought about by Alfred&amp;amp;amp;#39;s concern for hard wearing surface materials. He also created a number of Oxbridge Colleges - Balliol College (Oxford) and Pembroke College (Cambridge) - and Prudential Assurance Buildings, such as those in Holborn, Southampton and Leeds. Financially speaking, Waterhouse was probably the most successful of all Victorian architects. His planning skills were recognised at an early stage, but appreciation of his stylistic achievements has taken longer. Influenced by both Ruskin and Pugin, as well as the more practical approach of George Gilbert Scott, he developed his own slant on the composition of forms and a predilection for simple bold ornamentation to equal the growing scale of his designs. Though expert within Gothic and free Renaissance styles and having a preference for the Neo-Romanesque, Waterhouse did not limit himself to a single architectural look. He made a distinction between moulded or carved ornamentation on plain stone and naturally decorative materials, like veined marble, which he usually left unembellished. Such sensitive treatment of materials verged upon the aspirations of the Arts and Crafts Movement, but he always acknowledged construction as an industrial process. His buildings have characteristically bold and picturesque outlines and sound planning, with especial awareness of the urban skyline. Amongst his many honoured positions, he was President of the Royal Institute of British Architects from 1888 to 1891. Though a most prolific architect, best known for his large scale public and commercial buildings, Waterhouse was also a furniture designer and painter and built many smaller domestic buildings. For example, his own residences: Barcombe Cottage (at Fallowfield in Manchester 1864), Foxhill House (at Whiteknights in Earley, Berkshire 1868) and Yattendon Court (also in Berkshire 1877). This latter county was his home in his later years and he was well known for designing such local buildings as the town halls in both Reading and Wokingham. He erected a second house on the Whiteknights estate - Whiteknights House - for his father and was much involved with the adjoining school of Leighton Park. He eventually died in Yattendon in 1905.&amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;gt;	unknown						Yes	T.

It was Nottingham&amp;amp;#39;s first elementary school which educated both sexes free of charge. It took its name from the blue uniforms provided for the pupils from 1725 (before this date the clothes were grey in colour). &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The movement to set up charity schools began in the late seventeenth century as an attempt to combat crime and un-Christian behaviour. It sought to provide schooling for the children of the poor in &amp;amp;#39;pious instruction and education in the knowledge and practice of true religion&amp;amp;#39;.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The school was funded by voluntary subscription. After an initial meeting on 27 February 1706 to gain subscribers to the venture, the school opened on 1 May 1707, not at the building seen here, but possibly in a house loaned for the purpose in St Mary&amp;amp;#39;s Gate. The Nottingham Charity School undertook to clothe and teach forty children (25 male and 15 female) aged between 7 and 14, and apprentice them when their education was completed. In selecting pupils, the Trustees gave preference to orphans and those from large families. The children of those receiving poor relief were not eligible. &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;In 1723 the school moved to its first permanent location on High Pavement in a handsome building opposite Garners Hill. The school moved again in 1853 to a building on the west side of Mansfield Road (near the junction with Woodborough Road), which is now the International Community Centre. The School has now re-located yet again to far larger premises on Aspley Lane, which were opened in 1967.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;	1995	19_The_1990s	Beilby, Bernard				Yes	Bernard Beilby	EN-GB	JPEG/IMAGE	North East Midland Photographic Record	http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/uk/	General_Educational	victorian mullion school clock gable brickwork statue fence mullioned doorway entrance tree	 Clocks_and_Clock_Towers Buildings_and_Structures Schools_Colleges_and_Universities
